### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[7]

The authors do not provide their implementation, they do state 'we will release it to public shortly' in appendix B. They do directly link two sources they use in theirs and another in appendix B. High level implementation details given in 4.2. Pseudo code given in in appendix B algorithm 1/2. Overview in figure 1.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(2/2)

The authors use two popular benchmark datasets (NQ320K and TriviaQA), provide citations and describe them in 4.1. Statistics and direct links missing.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

Hyperparameters are stated informally in section 4.2. The authors motivate the selection of one value in appendix C. The other values are not explained. No structured overview.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors state and describe the metrics in 4.1. Datasets have predetermined splits. Results are single model. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries expertise on NLP document retrieval.
