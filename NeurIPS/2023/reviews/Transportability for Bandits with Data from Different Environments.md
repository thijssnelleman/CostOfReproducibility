### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide their implementation.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(3/3)

The authors use generated data. Their formulas are detailed in appendix D. Code not given. Parameterization explained.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The method has several semantic parameters which are defined in section 5. No optimisiable parameters based on algorithm 1.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

The authors present the results of experiment 1 as single runs, population defined in experiment 2 but aggregation/variation not completely clear adn the same for experiment 3. Metrics are expected reward and regret (problem/field specific). Data split not applicable.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[6]

Requries expertise on bandits.
