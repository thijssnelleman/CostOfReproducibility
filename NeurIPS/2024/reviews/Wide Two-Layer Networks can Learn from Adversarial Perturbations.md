### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors share a link to the implementation (https://github.com/s-kumano/perturbation-learning). In the readme the authors state how to set up, and how to run the code but very briefly and more information is welcome. Download links for generated data is given. Code has decent comments. Structure is overseeable.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors provide a download link in their implementation for generated data. The authors describe synthetic data generation in section 4 with distrubtions and parameter values. The generated data is avaiable by link in the implementation. More details are given in appendix B.1.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

Hyperparameter values are given in B.2. No acquisition specified.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The evaluation metric is accuracy. Results are on training data. Results are single classifier.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[2]

Requires experience with adversarial pertubation.
