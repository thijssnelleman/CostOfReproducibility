### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[5]

The authors collect data and model MDPs on it. Although it would be interesting to see the authors implementation on it, it is not the main point of this paper as they more focus on the evaluation of their framework. The authors do provide another public repository on which they based the implementation on. However, the absence of this code does mean it needs to be re-implemented from scratch which is still some effort.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(0/1)

The authors collect their own data and refer to the (not included due to AAAI limits) appendix regarding worker and acceptence criteria among other details regarding the study/data collection. They state they obtained 33 responses and give examples of the task descriptions. The authors do not seem to publish the data set, so it would have to be acquired from scratch, but given the known details defending comparability would be very little effort/difficulty.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

N/A

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The metrics are described and clear.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires a good understanding of MDP modelling.
