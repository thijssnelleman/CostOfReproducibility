### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link for their implementation (https://github.com/khalil-research/walkability). In the readme the authors shorty describe links on where to download the data, how to preprocess data, how to optimise models, how to extract the results and how to visualise them. The repository structure seems rather straightforward. The code could do with some more comments. The paper contains some pseudo code on the method and implementation details. In general this is very accessible although the repository documentation could be elaborated on a bit more.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

Details on how to download the data and preprocess it is given in the implementation documentation. Descriptions and citations on each data set is provided in the paper.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

There is a parameter t noted in the paper and for the values they point is to the missing appendix. Other than that the methods are seemingly presented as configuration free, but this needs verification.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors clearly describe the metrics used for the experiment and the procedure is straightforward. The implementation also provides verifiable details on this.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[2]

The method is a relatively accesible paper, although it does require some understanding of the task presented as some details (such as the metrics used) can be quite specific.
