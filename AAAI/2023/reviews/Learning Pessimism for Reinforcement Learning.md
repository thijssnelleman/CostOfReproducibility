### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors state in the paper they share their code to 'facilitate future extensions'. However, no reference to it can be found in the paper.  They refer to an extended version where more details can be found regarding (among other things) the implemenation. This is also not linked in the paper nor explained where it can be found. In principle, based on what the authors state in their paper, this could have been a 1.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(5/5)

The authors use 5 environments from an open source library and provide a citation on it. In general a link to it in the implementation documentation would be better, but this is good enough. There are no descriptions on the environments.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[9]

The authors refer to an extended version for their hyperparameter details. But no link to it can be found. The authors could have solved this by providing for example a link to their implementation documentation and placing this extended details there. There are some hyperparameter values given per experiment in the experiments section. Theoretically this could have been a 1.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors explain an experimental set up that is repeated five times with random seeds. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

The method requires a deep understanding of reinforcement learning. If the discussed extended documentation was to be found, this effort could be lower as independent investigators would have more source material to work with.
