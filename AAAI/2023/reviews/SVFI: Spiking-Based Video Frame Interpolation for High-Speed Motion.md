### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors provide a link to their implementation (https://github.com/Bosserhead/SVFI). The repository is completely empty. Some implementation details are specified in the paper, regarding the implementation library. A large illustration on the method is provided, but a detailed architecture schematic is not found.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(3/3)

The authors provide details and citations on their training data set, and the same on their testing data sets. They state use three benchmark datasets. Direct links are not provided and statistics are missing.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

Details on the hyperparameter settings are given, but not how they are acquired. Since they do not provide their implementation, it will take some effort to determine if all needed hyperparameters are given. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The training and testing data is clearly presented, and results table indicates they use single model results on the test set. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

The method requires a good understanding of computer vision.
