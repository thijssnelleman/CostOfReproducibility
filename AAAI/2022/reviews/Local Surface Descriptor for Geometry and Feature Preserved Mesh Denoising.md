### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide their source code. There are a few notes on the implementation details of other methods they use/source, but non of their own.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(4/4)

The authors use three data sources (four data sets) and provide citations on them, descriptions and meta data / statistics where relevant. Direct links are not provided (no implementation source) so some effort is needed to verify if they are indeed as accesible as it seems.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors provide several parameter settings in the experiments section. These seem to cover all needed values of their method. The hyperparameters for the models are also specified in the network training/structure sections. As the implementation is missing, this may take more effort to verify.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The experimental procedure is clearly provided in each tasks comaprison results section. The metric is stated, but could use some more clarification.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries a good understanding of the task to understand what exactly is evaluated and how.
