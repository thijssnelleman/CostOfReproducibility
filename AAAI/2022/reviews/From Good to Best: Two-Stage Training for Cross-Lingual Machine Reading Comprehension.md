### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[7]

The authors do not provide their implementation, but do link to the source of the model they build theirs on top of. The authors provide a high level architecture overview of their method and some examples.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(2/2)

The authors use two benchmark data sets in their experiments, both of which have a short description and citations. Statistics and direct link are not given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors state their hyperparameter values per task. It is difficult to verify if all needed values are presented as there is no implementation given. No acquisition method specified.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state their evaluation metrics which they motivate, and state they are common (And could thus be expected as pre-knowledge to the target audience). They state their experimental settings in two fold (zero-shot and translate-train), and explain them briefly. Based on the resulting graphs and tables they are single model/run results.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries an understanding of NLP and the specific task.
