### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors do not provide an implementation source. They provide certain details in their paper, such as libraries used, and refer for more details to the supplementary documentation which is missing (AAAI limitations). A general overview schematic is given. Short pseudo code is provided.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(3/3)

The authors state two public data sets are used for training and a third for testing and provide a bit of meta information on them with citations. Not much other information is provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[5]

Hyperparameter values are given in the implementation section and the authors refer to the supplementary material for more details. However this is missing (AAAI limitations) so we do not have all information needed. No specifications on search/budget. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state the training procedure, clarify their two evaluation procedures (Quantitative vs visual), briefly note their metrics, and the results indicate single run results but this is inferred.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries a good understanding of CV and the specific task regarding line completion.
