### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors main contribution is a theoretical analysis, however an emperical study is also done to support it. Multiple pieces of pseudo code is given on the method, but the implementation source is not given. This can make it quite difficult in this topic as the main aim is (reducing) computational complexity so mistakes in the re-implementation could easily lead to incomparable results.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(2/2)

The authors use two data sets, provide descriptions and statistics on them and the first one has a direct link presented, the second is cited. This makes the data very accesible.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

An analysis is done on their epsilon parameter (grid) and constant k. One parameter of the algorithms (see pseudo code) is not analysed. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The performance in the experimental results is defined over presented functions. The other given metrics are straightforward. The experiment is a direct execution of the method (under various parameter values) on the data sets, although a good understanding is needed of these functions to set up this experiment.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

The method presented is mainly a theoretical work and requires expertise on algorihmics and complexity, as well as the function defintions (including those in the experimental results). In general this is a mathematically complex work to understand.
