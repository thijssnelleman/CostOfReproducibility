### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide their implementation. No details on the implementation are specified. Schematics are given on the procedure (figure 2) and an overview (figure 1) and the training procedure (figure 3). 

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(2/2)

The authors use two benchmark data sets and provide citations on them a description on the data set is given, an some statistics are mentioned. No links to the data sets are provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors specify hyperparameters in their experiments section, but not how they were acquired. With the absence of implementation and pseudo code its hard to verify if all needed values are given.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

The authors specify test split for Pix3D with a citation on the procedure. They state how the results were acquired and note the metrics. Prior knowledge is needed to fully understand the procedure, as many details are either left to citation or expected to be understood by the target audience.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires previous experience with few shot learning to understand the presented method and experiments.
