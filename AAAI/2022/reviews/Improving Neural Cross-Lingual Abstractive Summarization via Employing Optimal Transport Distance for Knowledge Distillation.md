### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors do not provide a source to their implementation. They state they initialise their model with two previous works which they cite. They provide a diagram and and pseudo code on their method.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[5]

(1/3)

The authors use two data sets for which they cite a source regarding the pre processing and a third called Wikilingua which they cite. They provide some key statistics on the data sets. However more details would be welcome regarding where to find these data sets and how they were used. It is not clear if the datasets are public.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

Various hyperparameters are given in the implementation details, but it is difficult to verify if all needed values are presented. No details regarding acquisition strategy.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[7]

The authors do not introduce the metrics used, nor do they explain the method of the quantitative experiment. The framework of the human experiment is clearly stated including metrics, but without explanation of the metrics although they are quite standard in statistics.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires a good understanding of NLP.
