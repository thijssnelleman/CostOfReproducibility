### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[8] 

The authors do not provide their implementation but do state several sources which they use in their procedures. 

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors use a data set and provide a large description on it with a citation. They give a citation on their data pre-processing scripts. They state they which validation and test data sets they use. No statistics are provided on the data. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors provide their architecture details, and values of key hyperparameters. Its hard to estimate if all needed parameters are provided as implementation details are missing, however there is a decent amount of information provided. No details are given how these values were acquired.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state their training procedure, and what they use for validating/testing. The authors state they are using an experiment approach provided by Fairseq. They state the metrics they use for evaluation but no description. Based on the data description and the results table, they indicate these are single run results.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[3]

The method requires a good understanding of NLP.
