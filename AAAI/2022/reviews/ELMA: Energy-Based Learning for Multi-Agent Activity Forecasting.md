### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors provide a few notes in their paper on how the method was implemented, such as the library used. No implementation link is provided.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(2/2)

The authors use two large scale benchmark datasets. Citations on these are provided, descriptions given and extensive meta data provided. No direct link is given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[5]

The authors provide some key HP values in the experiment section, but is is likely some values are missing. No acquisition method/budget specified.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The experimental procedure is documented extensively in the paper, with citations provided to explain/motivate their decisions. All metrics are briefly described and cited in the criteria section. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

This method requires a good understanding of multi agent systems to understand. The absent implementation makes it very difficult to reproduce as, although there are examples given in the paper, it is a complex system that will require a lot of work and research using other papers.
