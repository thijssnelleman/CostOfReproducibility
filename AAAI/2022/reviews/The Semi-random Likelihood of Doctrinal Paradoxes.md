### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[5]

The authors do a theoretical study on the likelihood of the doctrinal paradox in logic aggregation between agents. They conduct a numerical experiment of their first theorem. For the expressions and fitness of each curve they refer to the appendix, which is missing (AAAI limitations). The implementation of this is not given. If the appendix were present this cost would be substantially lower.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(0/0)

The authors use expressions for their experiments, which are given in the missing appendix. Were this present, this should be 1.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

Not applicable.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors state they run one million independent trials to estimate the probability of the paradox under each distribution assignment.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

Requires a solid understanding of logic and the doctrinal paradox.
