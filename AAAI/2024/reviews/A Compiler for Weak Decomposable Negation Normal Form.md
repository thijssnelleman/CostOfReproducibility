### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[7]

The authors link a GitHub repository (https://github.com/Illner/BellaCompiler),, with instructions on how to run their compiler. However it does not include the source code of the compiler itself, which does mean a substanial amount of documentation is missing that would be useful for re-implementation. The authors do explain which components were used of other methods, and the source code of their modified parts. The paper includes an extensive Pseudocode description.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

Public benchmark data set was used for the method, and their source linked.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The method relatively parameter free, and includes some details regarding setting of seeds.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The experimental set up is straight forward, and the metrics clearly explained.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

The method requires extensive knowledge in knowledge compilation to understand the proofs presented. The lack of implementation documentation (e.g. no source code) increases the required expertise.
