### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

No implementation source is provided by the authors. There is an section on the architecture of the model and an illustration on it. However, real implementation details such as libraries/frameworks used are not present.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(4/4)

The authors use four data sets, and provide citations on them. Details on the data set and evaluation protocols should be available in supplementary material, but this is not present (not supported by AAAI). The authors state they are benchmark data sets, but except for citations, no links nor statistics are provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors state that their method is parameter free except for the backbone model. They demonstrate a parameter analysis for SFAM. It is a bit unclear which values are hyperparameters of the backbone and which are relevant.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[4]

The experimental procedure should be detailed in the supplementary material but this is not present. The metrics are denoted in the caption of the first table. They seem to be single evaluations, but it is a bit hard to verify without implementation documentation.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

A good understanding of representation learning is expected.
