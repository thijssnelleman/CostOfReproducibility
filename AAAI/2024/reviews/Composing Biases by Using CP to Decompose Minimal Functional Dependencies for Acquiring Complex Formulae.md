### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

The authors provide a github link with their source code (https://github.com/cquimper/MapSeekerAAAI24). It is extensively documented with a readme file, even including how to reproduce the specific results from their paper. The code is extensively, however the implementation seems highly complex, and would thus still require serious investment from independent investigators to implement it independently.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors provide the data generator used in their method, as well as clear instructions on how to generate the data used for the presented results.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors do not discuss any parameters regarding the method, nor was it clear from the implementation documentation. The independent investigators would either find parameters there to use, or they would not exist. Either way, determining this seems to be the real work.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The procedure is straight forward and presented in the implementation documentation.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

The documentation is extensive and the authors clearly demonstrate their method with conjectures and examples. However, although the authors state that it is "simple, may seem counterintuitive", it seems not an easy method to grasp or reproduce.
