### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors create teaching tools for children including custom notebooks, which they provide publicly on their own website (www.imagesteam.org).

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The data used by the students for their lessons is linked to their website, which is seemingly all freely available.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

Not applicable.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The study collects data (questionnare) and reviews the statistics on them in standardised notation.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[1]

Relatively accessible, method is well explained. An understandig of teaching methods / pedagogy might help.
