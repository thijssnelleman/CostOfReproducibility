### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

The authors provide a link to the implementation in a footnote of the abtract (https://github.com/minicheshire/Robust-Prefix-Tuning). In the readme they state installation requirements, how to run the training command with an explanation of the parameters, as well as how to calculate test performance, links to released materials, and acknowledgements for used repositories. The file structure needs an index. The code can use more comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(3/3)

The authors use three text classification benchmarks, SST-2, AG's News and SNLI and provide citations on them. No links or descriptions found.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[4]

The authors summarise the parameters and values in text in appendix B. A structured overview is missing and acquisition is not specified.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[3]

The authors report accuracy (Although not very clearly stated) on the test set of single runs. It is not specified how train/test are acquired from the dataset.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
