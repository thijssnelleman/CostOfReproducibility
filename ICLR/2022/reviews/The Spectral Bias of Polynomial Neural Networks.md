### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[8]

The authors provide implementation details in appendix G. Implementation is not provided.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[8]

(1/2)

The authors conduct an experiment on synthetic data (NTK regime, citation provided) and describe it in 4.1 but the implementation source is not clear. The image dataset seems not to be named.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[5]

The authors use the HP values of another work (cited) and is merely used as an example to conduct their analysis. However, it will still take some investigation to determine these values.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

The autors measure frequency (problem specific), PSNR (explained) over five runs averaged. The results are over training. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
