### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in the abstract (https://github.com/deeplearning-wisc/cider). In the readme they state how to download and prepare the data, what the repository structure should look like to use it, how to run the scritps with examples, where to download model checkpoints, which scripts to run for evaluation. The code has okay comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(7/7)

The authors us CIFAR-10/100, SVHN, Places365, Textures, LSUN and iSUN (citations provided for all). Few details given on the datasets. Download links for all in the implementation.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[2]

The authors state the HP settings in text in 4.1 and motivate the values based on a previous work to "demonstrate the simplicity and effectiveness". More details given in appendix B. Values are available per experiment in scripts (sort of "hard" coded) of the implementation, but full structured files are not given.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

The authors measure FPR and AUROC and use seperate datasets for evaluation. Results are single run.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
