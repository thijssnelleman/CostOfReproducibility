### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors state in the reproducibility statement that their work builds upon code that is already open-sourced and that their analysis code will be open-sourced. No links can be found to their code. An overview of the set up is given in figure 1 and 3.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(3/3)

The authors use the AI Habitat simulator, and the Gibson and Matterport3D datasets and provide citations on them. A description of the environment is given in section 2. No links provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[4]

The authors provide the hyperparameter values in text in appendix A.1. Structured overview is missing. Not all values are motivated/explained how they were acquired/chosen.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[4]

The authors evaluate on the Matterport3D test set (static) and measure Success / SPL as well as performance. Results are presented with mean and standard deviation it seems but its unclear over what exactly. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
