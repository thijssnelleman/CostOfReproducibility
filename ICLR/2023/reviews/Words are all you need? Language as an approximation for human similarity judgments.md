### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to the code and data in footnote 2 of the appendix (https://osf.io/kzbr5/?view_only=3dea58e008ce41c290ef0f374bdbf444). In appendix B.2. they provide details on the implementation. Contains multiple readmes describing the structure overview of the repo. Code has good comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(3/3)

The authors describe the used datasets, citations provided, in section 2 and the entire procedure surrounding their own collected data. The authors provide a link to all collected data in appendix A.1. Details on the other datasets are a bit lacking.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[1]

The authors use pretrained models and evaluate them. They describe a single parameter and its value in 3.3. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

The authors state and explain the metric in 3.5. The authors evaluate pretrained models over the datasets. The results are presented averaged over the models with standard deviations.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
