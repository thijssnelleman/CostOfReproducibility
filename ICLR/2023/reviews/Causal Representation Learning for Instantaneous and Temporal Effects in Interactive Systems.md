### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in section 5 (https://github.com/phlippe/CITRIS). Readme contains dataset information, index on the structure, how to run experiments with a sperate folder dedicated to examples and an installation requirements file. Code has good comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(4/4)

The authors use CITRIS, Temporal Causal3DIdent dataset, CAUSAL PINBALL, and VORONOI BENCHMARK. Data sets are explained in 5.2-5.4 and appendix E in detail. The authors provide links and generators in the implementation. Citations provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[1]

The authors discuss HPs in appendix F, including a highly detailed overview per experiment. Not all values motivated.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

Evaluation metrics detailed in 5.1. and F.3. Results are single run.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
