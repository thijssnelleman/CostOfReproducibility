### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in the reproducibility statement (https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/learning-human-compatible-representations). The readme is practically empty. There is a requirements txt file for dependencies but does not have any versioning nor details. Code has few comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(3/3)

The authors use Vespula vs Weel (cited, described), Butterflies v.s. Moths and a medical image dataset of chest X-rays both wof which are cited and described. Datasets and links provided in implementation. Descriptions could be more detailed.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[4]

Authors provide HP values in text in appendix C without motivation. Structured overview missing.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[3]

Metrics stated in section 3. Data split stated in 4.1 and 5.1. Authors show 95% CI, but aggregation/population not clear.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
