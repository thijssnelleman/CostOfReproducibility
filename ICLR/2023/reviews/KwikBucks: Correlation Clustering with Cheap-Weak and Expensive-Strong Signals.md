### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[8]

The authors do not provide their implementation. Pseudo code in algorithm 1-6. and state two packages used in appendix E with citation.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(8/9)

The authors use Stackoverﬂow and SearchSnippets, Twitter and AgNews data, Citeseer and Microsoft Medicine and Cora and Amazon Electronics Photos and an internal private dataset. All datasets are described with citations in appendix E. The internal dataset has a very briefy description and download links are missing.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[1]

The authors provide some details in text per dataset in appendix E, and HP strategy for their method is given 4.1 and appendix F.2.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[3]

Metrics explained in 4.1. Data split not applicable. Aggregation/variation not specified.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
