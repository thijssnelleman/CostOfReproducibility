### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[4]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in the abstract (https://github.com/VITA-Group/ramanujan-on-pai). There is no readme. There are few comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(1/1)

CIFAR-10, citation provided but no other information.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[3]

HPs summarised in table 1. Acquisition not given.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[3]

Authors measure Ramanujan characteristic and Random Coefficient and IMDB (introduced and explained here). Data splits not clear. Results are single runs.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
