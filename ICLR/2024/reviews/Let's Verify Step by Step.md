### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Authors provide a link to the implementation in appendix B. The authors publish a dataset which can be found there. But they also show the effectiveness of their model PRM ("our state of the art PRM") but this is not given. 

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors publish a new dataset, share it in a link, and the process of collection is very well documented (sec 2.4). 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[9]

HP details given in appendix F, but are incomplete.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

Data splits given in link. Authors measure % of problems solved with mean and std dev over 3 seeds.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
