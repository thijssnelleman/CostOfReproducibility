### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

Authors provide a link to the implementation in section 6 (https://github.com/ujk21/dyn-informed). Readme contains installation instructions, how to run the code with a very brief example and a brief overview of the structure (Together +1). Code has good comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(1/1)

The authors construct a dataset using all CATHv4.3 domains, the implementation contains a dataset file but its not specified whether this is this dataset. In general quite some information on how this dataset is created seems to be unclear, although statistics given in app. A.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[2]

HP values and selection detailed (without budget) in appendix B. Structured overview missing.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[3]

Metrics specified in 4.3. Split not specified. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
