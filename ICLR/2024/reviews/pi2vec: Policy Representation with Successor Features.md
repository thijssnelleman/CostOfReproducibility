### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Implementation not provided. High level overviews in figure 1/2.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(0/5)

Insert Gear (Sim), Metaworld, and Franka-Kitchen, and two real domains—Insert Gear (Real) and RGB Stacking. They are described in appendix 7.1. Citations given but no implementation.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[7]

Architecture detailed in appendix 7.2 in text. Not all values given. No structured overview. No acquisition. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[3]

Metrics described in section 4. K-fold cross validation over the set Π and report results averaged (with confidence interval, 95% implied but not specified) over cross validation fold. K not specified.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
