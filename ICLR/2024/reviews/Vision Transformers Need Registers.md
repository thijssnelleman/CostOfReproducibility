### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

Implementation not provided. The authors do provide links of the three previous works they apply hteir method on which serves as a good starting point. No other details provided.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[8]

(3/4)

ImageNet-22k, and an unnamed dataset based on Shutterstock (see 3.1.) that is used for training. ADE20K, NYUd monocular depth estimation are used as well. No details provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[8]

Not detailed, except a few references to previous works.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[4]

Top-1 mIoU rmse, all standard. Results are single. Data split not clear.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
