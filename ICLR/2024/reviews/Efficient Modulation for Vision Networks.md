### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

Authors provide implementation link in the abstract (https://github.com/ma-xu/EfficientMod). In the readme they state installation instructions, where to download model checkpoints, how to run code with examples. Code has few comments and structure is difficult to get through.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(3/3)

IMAGENET-1K, MS COCO, ADE20K, citations provided. No descriptions or links.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[3]

HP values summarised in figure 5 and table 8. No acquisition.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[4]

Authors measure Params FLOPs Acc. top-1 acc. Data split unclear. Single runs.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
