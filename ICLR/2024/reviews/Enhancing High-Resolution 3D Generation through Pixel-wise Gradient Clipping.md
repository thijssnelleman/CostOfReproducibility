### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

Authors provide a project link above the abstract, where they link their code (https://github.com/fudan-zvg/PGC-3D). Readme has an overview of the method, how to install and details in which environment it has been verified, details on code entry points and its arguments with examples, list of tips. Structure is very large and needs an index. Comments are good.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(1/1)

COCO (cited). Details are few. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[4]

Authors state in 5.1 they do not conduct HP tuning and provide HP values in text. Value acquisition not clear. No structured overview.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[7]

The authors use COCO for evaluation. It is unclear what is trained on. Results are mainly qualitative.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
