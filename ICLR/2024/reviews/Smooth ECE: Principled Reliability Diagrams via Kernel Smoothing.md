### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in the abstract (https://github.com/apple/ml-calibration). The readme has an overview of the method, how to install, example code. Code has ok comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(4/4)

ResNet validation set results on ImageNet, Solar Flares, Precipitation in Finland, all cited and described. They also use a simple synthetic dataset which they describe. Links in notebooks provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[1]

The presented method is HP free.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

The authors visually demonstrate their method.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
