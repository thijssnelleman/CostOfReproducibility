### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in footnote 2 of section 5 (https://github.com/nonicohen/HeurEvCost). There are no installation  instructions. Code could use more comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(1/1)

The authors generate data (AFFE) and use the parameters of the method as input for it. The generator code is given. Description is lacking.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors list the parameters and their values in section 5 (grids) and the selected values per figure.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors measure tree evid cost reduction in comparison to a baseline over deactivation quota and number of tree nodes. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires expertise on evidence retrieval cost.
