### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors state the method is developed in R in section 6 and that the code is available upon request. We sent a request to all authors regarding this on 16-04-2025 at 20:53, and received the authors delivered on 22-04-2025 at 10:11. The code has okay comments. The structure is accesible (6 code files). There are no installation instructions.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(2/2)

The authors generate data and state the models in 6.2. Implementation given in the code, with summary of parameter values. The authors conduct real-world data in section 7. They use the Pillar Dataset and provide descriptions, citations but few statistics and no link (the link provided is the source of the dataset, not the actual dataset).

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors state a gamma parameter and define it with a formula.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[4]

The authors present boxplots over the emperical size / empirical power percentage over statitsical tests. To understand the evaluation requires a solid statistical basis. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

Requires expertise on independence tests.
