### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in the introduction (https://github.com/reail-iitd/tango). In the readme they state a link to a wiki for getting started with installation instructions. Code needs more comments. Directory structure overview given in the wiki. Overview in figure 2.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors use an environment and discuss it in section 3. They also describe an environment in section 5.1. and describe sources they used for creation with a lot of details. The dataset is available in the implementation. The human annotated corpus is detailed in 5.2 with statistics. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors list the Hps with a description and their values in appendix B. Acquisition not specified.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

Data split given in 5.3. and evaluation metrics in 6.1.2. Results are single models on the test sets. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires expertise on common sense generalization.
