### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Implementation not given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(0/1)

The authors create a simulated environment and define it in 3.1 and give the parameters values in 3.3. Implementation not given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors state the hyperparameter values in 3.3, most are evaluated over grids. Not all parameters are clearly defined however and its confusingly stated with the environment parameters. No structured overview and the 'forgetting parameter' value is only given.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors measure group achievement, achieved contribution, escured welfare and policy over risk r (defined in sec 4). The results are presented with standard deviation over 5 runs. Data split not applicable. Aggregation not stated.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires expertise on environment simulation and cooperation/learning dynamics.
