### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

No implementation given. 

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[5]

(2/3)

The authors present the Leeds Object Affordance dataset in section 7 and describe it there in detail, provide statistics on it in figure 8/9 but they are high level. The acquisition and format is not completely clear. It seems to be private. The authors also use the CAD-120 and Watch-n-Patch dataset and cite it with a brief description and high level statistics but no other information given. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors discuss parameters in 8.3. and discuss a few grids they were selected over empirically and state the selected value. No structured overview or budget given.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[6]

The authors evaluate V-measure, homogeneity and completeness and describe them but do not provide a definition. The authors state the data split in 8.1 for CAD, and state for the other 2 datasets they were conducted on 24/15 handpicked videos (unclear).

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

Requires expertise on graph embeddings.
