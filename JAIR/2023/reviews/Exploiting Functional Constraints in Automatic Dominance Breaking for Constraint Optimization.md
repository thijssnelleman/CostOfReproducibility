### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in footnote 1 (https://github.com/AllenZzw/auto-dom). In the readme they state which compiler requirements their code has and how to build it, how to use the code with an example, and what the output looks like. There is also a seperate change log. There is a seperate documentation directory but there is no published website version of it. The code could use more comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(6/6)

The authors use six benchmark problems (Talent scheduling, Warehouse location, Team assignment, budget maxmimum coverage, partial cover and sensor placement) and all have a citation provided. There is some notes on it in section 5 as well. There are a lot of datafiles but its unclear what belongs to what, whether the files used for the experiments are included is definetily not clear.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors state 5 different configurations in section 5 used for the experiments, which are modular parts of the solver being exchanged. No other parameters noted and the code seems to also need any other parameters.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors set the solving process timeout to 7200 seconds and report the number of solved instances and geometric mean of total time in seconds. They vary the value of n (explained per problem).

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries expertise on constraint optimisation.
