### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors provide two repository links, the first of which is their main implementation (https://github.com/yizmirlioglu/nCDC). Here they state details on the system, how input can be provided, how it can be checked that everything works, details on example scenarios and where to find files, and how to run experiments for the thesis. Code has okay comments. No installation instructions.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[7]

(2/2)

The authors randomly generated benchmark problem instances and state it in 12.4. and its very briefly described and the code is not available. Some benchmarks are stated to be hand crafted. Its unclear where each comes from. There are datasets available in the implementation. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

No parameters discussed.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors measure computational time over the instances.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requries expertise on answer set programming.
