### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The auhtors state pseudo code on their method in algorithm 1. Implementation is not given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(3/3)

In section 7 the authors use simulated data and describe it in 7.1 and state parameter value of epsiolon per experiment. Implementation not given. In section 8 the authors conduct real world experiments. The authors use historical prices of bitcoins and link a Kaggle dataset in footnote 3. The authors link an implementation for the hybrid car environment in footnote 4. The environments/tasks are described.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[9]

The authors state the hyperparameter selection objective in 7.2. on the dataset or 100 rollouts. Actual procedure not described. Its unclear what the authors actually consider as HPs (not clear from pseudo code) and what the values are.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors present the results averaged over 30 runs and present error bars for one standard error or present the results as 90th percentile over 90 runs. The metrics are difference (formula given) and another formula J(pi ,M) defined in 5.2, price improvement / true cost (task specific).

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[8]

Requries expertise on RL.
