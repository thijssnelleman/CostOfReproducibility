### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Implementation not given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(3/3)

The authors use three benchmark problem sets, describe them briefly and cite them, but do not provide links or further details/statistics.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[8]

The authors state some parameter details in section 6. and for example what d values were tested but not which were selected. For other methods its unclear: For example they state they use a neural network appraoch but no details like architecture etc.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors measure number of problems solved over number of programs evaluated, each experiment on cut off time of 120 minutes and also visualised in running time in seconds. The authors reporte average + std deviation over 5 independent runs.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires expertise on program synthesis.
