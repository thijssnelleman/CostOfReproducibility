### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in section 5.1 footnote 2 (https://github.com/shahink84/ContractSchdulingWithPredictions). In the readme they state compilation instructions, how to provide input parameters, how to run the code, and what the output will look like. Code has nice comments. Structure is okay.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors imulate data in their experiments and describe the process in section 5. Code on it is provided and parameter values given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors evaluate the methods with various values of p and r but some values are fixed and its not clear which parameter belongs to what part of the method or how the values are acquired (some are motivated theoretically).

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors measure percentage of interruptions and empirical acceleration ratio (eq. 1). averaged over 1,000 predictions.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[6]

Requires expertise on contract scheduling.
