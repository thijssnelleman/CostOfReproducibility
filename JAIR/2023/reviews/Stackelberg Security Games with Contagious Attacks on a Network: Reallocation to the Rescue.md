### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

Implementation not given. The authors sate they use Gurobi as part of their experiment.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(8/8)

The authors use both synthetic and real world datasets, (Rand-S, Rand-L, Pow-S, Pow-L and Air-US, Email-EU, Facebook and Twitter). The data tegneration process and source code is linked and parameter values are given. The datasets are described and cited. No direct links. High level statistics in a table in section 6.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[9]

The authors define ε and τ as algorithm parameters in 6.2. Their values are unclear.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors measure defending result (explained) over various k and eta values. The authors also measure running time in seconds. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[8]

Requries expertise on network security games.
