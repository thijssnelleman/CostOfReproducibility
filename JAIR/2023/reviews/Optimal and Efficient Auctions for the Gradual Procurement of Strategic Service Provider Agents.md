### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Implementation not given. Pseudo code in algorithm 1.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[7]

(4/4)

The authors use four different simulation environments, the authors give a high level description with some parameter values stated, but the implementation is not given and the process is only stated informally.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors state the method in algorithm 1 and it has three parameters but they are all input related. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

The authors measure serbice rate of hired providers over time, a deadline over an unknown y axis, cosnumers expected utility over number of providers. The metrics are defined in 9.1.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[6]

Requries expertise on the presented problem and game theory.
