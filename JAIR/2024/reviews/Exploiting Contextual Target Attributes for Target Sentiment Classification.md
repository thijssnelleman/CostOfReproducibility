### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors link a parser they use in their implementation in section 3. Implementation not given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(3/3)

The authors use Restaurant 14, Laptop14 and Restaurant15 and provide citations. Descriptions are lacking. The authors state statistics on the data set in table 2 but they are not very information rich. No direct link.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors state the hyperparameter values in table 3. No acquisition specified.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors measure Accuracy and F1 score. Data split stated in table 2 (static provided split). Results are reported averaged over three random init runs. It is not actually stated on which split they report the results, only implied.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires expertise on NLP.
