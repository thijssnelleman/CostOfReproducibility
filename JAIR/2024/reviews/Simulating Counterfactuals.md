### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in section 4 (https://github.com/JuhaKarvanen/simulating_counterfactuals). In the readme they state an overview of the files and a brief note regarding installation (Uses R6casual 0.8.3). Code can use better comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors use simulated data in section 5 and describe the process in section 4 and statistics in table 1. Implementation is given. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

Based on algorithm 1/2, the method seems to be parameter free.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors describe the measurements in each column of table 1 in the caption. Split not applicable.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[8]

Requries expertise with counterfactual inference.
