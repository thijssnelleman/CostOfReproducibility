### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[4]

The authors link their implementation in section 7 (https://github.com/auroralab-unipr/PMT). There is no readme. No installation instructions. Code has few comments. Structure could use an index due to the lack of comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(1/1)

The authors generate data in 7.1/7.2 and state the library/function used to do this with the parameters but a description on how this actually works is lacking.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

Methods are parameter free.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors evaluate average number of moves. Each point is a result.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires expertise on PMT problem and algorithmic complexity / analysis.
