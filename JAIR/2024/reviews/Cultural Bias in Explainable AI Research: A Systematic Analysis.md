### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors collect data for analysis. In 3.1. its clear that, although they used a query to cllect data, most data was filter/extracted 'by hand'. Implementation not/less applicable.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(1/1)

The authors collect their own data set and state the process in extensive detail in 3.1 as well as the appendix. The authors state the data is publicly accesible in 3.1 with a 'link' that does not work, so this will have to be resolved by the independent investigators.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

N/A

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors analyse the data over various dimensions and state the selection process. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[3]

Requires expertise on bias and explainable AI.
