### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in footnote 5 (https://github.com/Arseni1919/dcop_simulator_5).In the readme they state the algorithms implemented, some details on the experiments, a code example, and credits. All descriptions are very brief. The code can use more comments. There are no installation instructions.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(1/1)

The authors use a benchmark dataset which they provide direct links to. The tasks are described and statistics are less applicable in this case. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The only parameter their method seems to have is iterations, which the authors set to 10 in section 7.1. The acquisition of this is not clear.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors present the results with mean and standard deviation in the appendix. The metric is remaining coverage requirement, explained in 3.3. The population is not completely clear. The figures present single runs. Data split not applicable.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires expertise on distributed optimization.
