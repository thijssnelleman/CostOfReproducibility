### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

The authors provide a link to their project page in section 7 footnote 5 where they link their implementation (https://github.com/toad-planner-dev/ToadPlanningSystem) and also state on which frameworks their method builds upon and a library they use. In the readme they state how to run the code and a list of publications. Code can use more comments. Compilation requirements not clear. 

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(1/1)

The authors use the IPC 2020 benchmark dataset and state properties in table 1. Citation is given. Descriptions are a bit lacking, no direct link.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

Paramter free.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors measure time to build the automaton in seconds. In table 2 they measure the size of automate in procentual w.r.t. the original and std dev over each domain.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries expertise on translating HTN.
