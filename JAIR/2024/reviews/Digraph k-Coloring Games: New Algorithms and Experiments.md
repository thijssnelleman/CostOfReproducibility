### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[3]

The authors state in which languages the code has been written in in 6.2. and opensource toolkit they used (with citation) and provide a link to it in footnote 1 (https://github.com/buildfreak/digraph_k_col_experimentation). The link contains a license. Code needs more comments. No installation instructions.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[5]

(30/30)

The authors state the datasets used in 6.1. both from real-world as artifical/generated instances. Parameters of generation are stated. More details are given in table 1 including statistics. No citations, links provided and generation code is not available.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The method takes a maximum number of iterations, which is set to a formula. There is also a note on an epsilon parameter, which is used with various values on a grid stated in 6.4.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors evaluate the methods on running time in seconds and some other metrics stated in 6.3. Results are single run. Data split not applicable.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires expertise on graph coloring problem.
