### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors provide a link to their implementation in the introduction (https://github.com/szufix/mapel). Here they state in the readme that it has been trasnformed into a new package and link it. They have a seperate readme per directory, and one regarding package overview and installation. The code has a documentation website (but has been moved to the new package). In general the comments are okay.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(2/2)

The authors present a link for generated SR and SM instances. They describe the generation process for SR in 5.1. and an overview in table 1. Figure 2, 3, 4 and 5 give extensive statistics on the data. In section 7 they do the same for the SM dataset.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

There are parameter values given regarding the synthetic dataset generation, no other parameters applicable.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors analyse and visualise their dataset. Measurements are standard statistical terms. No data split applicable.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[3]

Requires expertise on data analyis, synthetic data and data mapping.
