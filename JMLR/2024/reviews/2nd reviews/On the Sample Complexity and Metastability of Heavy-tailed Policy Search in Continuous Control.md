### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

no code +4
no implementation details +4
pseudo code provided


### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[5]

(2/2)

one generated dataset I'd have to search online to get more details about, no code, no clear process 8
one with name, citation and detailed explanation of what the dataset is about, no direct link 2
both weight 50-50

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

detailed in text, no overview +1
no strategy to chose the value +2

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

common metric
split and strategy not really applicable (RL)
well explained figures

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

lots of maths and theorems, but big part of it is to explain concepts that could have been just mentioned if they aimed at an expert audience
