### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide their implementation for the simulation results. Pseudo code in algorithm 1 and 2.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(1/1)

The authors use simulations for their experiments. They describe the settings and parameters in section 5 briefly. The problem is explained in the introduction. The implementation is not given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors state various input parameters in algorithm 1. They are named 'state-dependent exploration-exploitation coefficients'. Their values are given in section 5. Acquisition unclear.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The experiments are simulated for 2x10^4 episodes with 10^7 independent runs. The metrics are average (aggregation) total regret (environment specific). No variance or data split applicable.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[8]

Requires expertise on RL.
