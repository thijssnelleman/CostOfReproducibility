### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Implementation not given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(1/1)

The authors conduct simulations studies and specify the model in equation 22 and in section 5.4. Parameters specified. Implementation not given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors state pseudo code in algorithm 1 and 2 and they only discuss a bits budget B which they vary in the experiments / iterate over.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

They evaluate the method over B iterations with log of RMSE. They state the variation of sample size per graph. Results are single run.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[9]

Requires expertise on quantization.
