"19301","On Truthing Issues in Supervised Classification","Jonathan K. Su","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/19-301/19-301.pdf","","Ideal supervised classification assumes known correct labels, but various truthing issues can arise in practice: noisy labels; multiple, conflicting labels for a sample; missing labels; and different labeler combinations for different samples. Previous work introduced a noisy-label model, which views the observed noisy labels as random variables conditioned on the unobserved correct labels. It has mainly focused on estimating the conditional distribution of the noisy labels and the class prior, as well as estimating the correct labels or training with noisy labels. In a complementary manner, given the conditional distribution and class prior, we apply estimation theory to classifier testing, training, and comparison of different combinations of labelers. First, for binary classification, we construct a testing model and derive approximate marginal posteriors for accuracy, precision, recall, probability of false alarm, and F-score, and joint posteriors for ROC and precision-recall analysis.  We propose minimum mean-square error (MMSE) testing, which employs empirical Bayes algorithms to estimate the testing-model parameters and then computes optimal point estimates and credible regions for the metrics. We extend the approach to multi-class classification to obtain optimal estimates of accuracy and individual confusion-matrix elements. Second, we present a unified view of training that covers probabilistic (i.e., discriminative or generative) and non-probabilistic models.  For the former, we adjust maximum-likelihood or maximum a posteriori training for truthing issues; for the latter, we propose MMSE training, which minimizes the MMSE estimate of the empirical risk. We also describe suboptimal training that is compatible with existing infrastructure. Third, we observe that mutual information lets one express any labeler combination as an equivalent single labeler, implying that multiple mediocre labelers can be as informative as, or more informative than, a single expert labeler.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and confirm the implication."
"210264","Lower Complexity Bounds of Finite-Sum Optimization Problems: The Results and Construction","Yuze Han, Guangzeng Xie, Zhihua Zhang","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-0264/21-0264.pdf","","In this paper we study the lower complexity bounds for finite-sum optimization problems, where the objective is the average of $n$ individual component functions. We consider a so-called proximal incremental first-order oracle (PIFO) algorithm, which employs the individual component function's gradient and proximal information provided by PIFO to update the variable. To incorporate loopless methods, we also allow the PIFO algorithm to obtain the full gradient infrequently. We develop a novel approach to constructing the hard instances, which partitions the tridiagonal matrix of classical examples into $n$ groups. This construction is friendly to the analysis of PIFO algorithms. Based on this construction, we establish the lower complexity bounds for finite-sum minimax optimization problems when the objective is convex-concave or nonconvex-strongly-concave and the class of component functions is $L$-average smooth. Most of these bounds are nearly matched by existing upper bounds up to log factors. We also derive similar lower bounds for finite-sum minimization problems as previous work under both smoothness and average smoothness assumptions. Our lower bounds imply that proximal oracles for smooth functions are not much more powerful than gradient oracles."
"211137","Power of knockoff: The impact of ranking algorithm, augmented design, and symmetric statistic","Zheng Tracy Ke, Jun S. Liu, Yucong Ma","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-1137/21-1137.pdf","","The knockoff filter is a recent false discovery rate (FDR) control method for high-dimensional linear models. We point out that knockoff has three key components: ranking algorithm, augmented design, and symmetric statistic, and each component admits multiple choices. By considering various combinations of the three components, we obtain a collection of variants of knockoff. All these variants guarantee finite-sample FDR control, and our goal is to compare their power. We assume a Rare and Weak signal model on regression coeffi- cients and compare the power of different variants of knockoff by deriving explicit formulas of false positive rate and false negative rate. Our results provide new insights on how to improve power when controlling FDR at a targeted level. We also compare the power of knockoff with its propotype - a method that uses the same ranking algorithm but has access to an ideal threshold. The comparison reveals the additional price one pays by finding a data-driven threshold to control FDR."
"211205","Fast Policy Extragradient Methods for Competitive Games with Entropy Regularization","Shicong Cen, Yuting Wei, Yuejie Chi","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-1205/21-1205.pdf","","This paper investigates the problem of computing the equilibrium of competitive games in the form of  two-player zero-sum games, which is often modeled as a constrained saddle-point optimization problem with probability simplex constraints. Despite recent efforts in understanding the last-iterate convergence of extragradient methods in the unconstrained setting, the theoretical underpinnings of these methods in the constrained settings, especially those using multiplicative updates, remain highly inadequate, even when the objective function is bilinear. Motivated by the algorithmic role of entropy regularization in single-agent reinforcement learning and game theory, we develop provably efficient extragradient methods to find the quantal response equilibrium (QRE)---which are solutions to zero-sum two-player matrix games with entropy regularization---at a linear rate. The proposed algorithms can be implemented in a decentralized manner, where each player executes symmetric and multiplicative updates iteratively using its own payoff without observing the opponent's actions directly. In addition, by controlling the knob of entropy regularization, the proposed algorithms can locate an approximate Nash equilibrium of the unregularized matrix game at a sublinear rate without assuming the Nash equilibrium to be unique. Our methods also lead to efficient policy extragradient algorithms for solving (entropy-regularized) zero-sum Markov games at similar rates. All of our convergence rates are nearly dimension-free, which are independent of the size of the state and action spaces up to logarithm factors, highlighting the positive role of entropy regularization for accelerating convergence."
"220402","Seeded Graph Matching for the Correlated Gaussian Wigner Model via the Projected Power Method","Ernesto Araya, Guillaume Braun, Hemant Tyagi","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0402/22-0402.pdf","https://github.com/ErnestoArayaV/Graph-matching-PPMGM","In the graph matching problem we observe two graphs $G,H$ and the goal is to find an assignment (or matching) between their vertices such that some measure of edge agreement is maximized. We assume in this work that the observed pair $G,H$ has been drawn from the Correlated Gaussian Wigner (CGW) model -- a popular model for correlated weighted graphs -- where the entries of the adjacency matrices of $G$ and $H$ are independent Gaussians and each edge of $G$ is correlated with one edge of $H$ (determined by the unknown matching) with the edge correlation  described by a parameter $\sigma \in [0,1)$. In this paper, we analyse the performance of the projected power method (PPM) as a seeded graph matching algorithm where we are given an initial partially correct matching (called the seed) as side information. We prove that if the seed is close enough to the ground-truth matching, then with high probability, PPM iteratively improves the seed and recovers the ground-truth matching (either partially or exactly) in $O(\log n)$ iterations. Our results prove that PPM works even in regimes of constant $\sigma$, thus extending the analysis in (Mao et al., 2023) for the sparse Correlated Erdos-Renyi (CER) model to the (dense) CGW model. As a byproduct of our analysis, we see that the PPM framework generalizes some of the state-of-art algorithms for seeded graph matching. We support and complement our theoretical findings with numerical experiments on synthetic data."
"220687","Model-Free Representation Learning and Exploration in Low-Rank MDPs","Aditya Modi, Jinglin Chen, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Nan Jiang, Alekh Agarwal","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0687/22-0687.pdf","","The low-rank MDP has emerged as an important model for studying representation learning and exploration in reinforcement learning. With a known representation, several model-free exploration strategies exist. In contrast, all algorithms for the unknown representation setting are model-based, thereby requiring the ability to model the full dynamics. In this work, we present the first model-free representation learning algorithms for low-rank MDPs. The key algorithmic contribution is a new minimax representation learning objective, for which we provide variants with differing tradeoffs in their statistical and computational properties. We interleave this representation learning step with an exploration strategy to cover the state space in a reward-free manner. The resulting algorithms are provably sample efficient and can accommodate general function approximation to scale to complex environments."
"220801","Decorrelated Variable Importance","Isabella Verdinelli, Larry Wasserman","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0801/22-0801.pdf","","Because of the widespread use of black box prediction methods such as random forests and neural nets, there is renewed interest in developing methods for quantifying variable importance as part of the broader goal of interpretable prediction. A popular approach is to define a variable importance parameter --- known as LOCO (Leave Out COvariates) --- based on dropping covariates from a regression model.  This is essentially a nonparametric version of $R^2$. This parameter is very general and can be estimated nonparametrically, but it can be hard to interpret because it is affected by correlation between covariates. We propose a method for mitigating the effect of correlation by defining a modified version of LOCO. This new parameter is difficult to estimate nonparametrically, but we show how to estimate it using semiparametric models."
"221120","On Efficient and Scalable Computation of the Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood Estimator in Mixture Models","Yangjing Zhang, Ying Cui, Bodhisattva Sen, Kim-Chuan Toh","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-1120/22-1120.pdf","https://github.com/YangjingZhang/Dual-ALM-for-NPMLE","In this paper, we focus on the computation of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) in multivariate mixture models. Our approach discretizes this infinite dimensional convex optimization problem by setting fixed support points for the NPMLE and optimizing over the mixing proportions. We propose an efficient and scalable semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). Our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (Kim et al., 2020; Koenker and Gu, 2017), capable of handling $n \approx 10^6$ data points with $m \approx 10^4$ support points. A key advantage of our approach is its strategic utilization of the solution's sparsity, leading to structured sparsity in Hessian computations. As a result, our algorithm demonstrates better scaling in terms of $m$ when compared to the mixsqp method (Kim et al., 2020). The computed NPMLE can be directly applied to denoising the observations in the framework of empirical Bayes. We propose new denoising estimands in this context along with their consistent estimates. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of our ALM. In particular, we employ our method to analyze two astronomy data sets: (i) Gaia-TGAS Catalog (Anderson et al., 2018) containing approximately $1.4 \times 10^6$ data points in two dimensions, and (ii) a data set from the APOGEE survey (Majewski et al., 2017) with approximately $2.7 \times 10^4$ data points."
"221251","Exploration, Exploitation, and Engagement in Multi-Armed Bandits with Abandonment","Zixian Yang, Xin Liu, Lei Ying","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-1251/22-1251.pdf","","The traditional multi-armed bandit (MAB) model for recommendation systems assumes the user stays in the system for the entire learning horizon. In new online education platforms such as ALEKS or new video recommendation systems such as TikTok, the amount of time a user spends on the app depends on how engaging the recommended contents are. Users may temporarily leave the system if the recommended items cannot engage the users. To understand the exploration, exploitation, and engagement in these systems, we propose a new model, called MAB-A where “A” stands for abandonment and the abandonment probability depends on the current recommended item and the user's past experience (called state). We propose two algorithms, ULCB and KL-ULCB, both of which do more exploration (being optimistic) when the user likes the previous recommended item and less exploration (being pessimistic) when the user does not. We prove that both ULCB and KL-ULCB achieve logarithmic regret, $O(\log K)$, where $K$ is the number of visits (or episodes). Furthermore, the regret bound under KL-ULCB is asymptotically sharp. We also extend the proposed algorithms to the general-state setting. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have significantly lower regret than the traditional UCB and KL-UCB, and Q-learning-based algorithms."
"221317","Modeling Random Networks with Heterogeneous Reciprocity","Daniel Cirkovic, Tiandong Wang","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-1317/22-1317.pdf","","Reciprocity, or the tendency of individuals to mirror behavior, is a key measure that describes information exchange in a social network. Users in social networks tend to engage in different levels of reciprocal behavior. Differences in such behavior may indicate the existence of communities that reciprocate links at varying rates. In this paper, we develop methodology to model the diverse reciprocal behavior in growing social networks. In particular, we present a preferential attachment model with heterogeneous reciprocity that imitates the attraction users have for popular users, plus the heterogeneous nature by which they reciprocate links. We compare Bayesian and frequentist model fitting techniques for large networks, as well as computationally efficient variational alternatives. Cases where the number of communities is known and unknown are both considered. We apply the presented methods to the analysis of Facebook and Reddit networks where users have non-uniform reciprocal behavior patterns. The fitted model captures the heavy-tailed nature of the empirical degree distributions in the datasets and identifies multiple groups of users that differ in their tendency to reply to and receive responses to wallposts and comments."
"221396","Estimating the Minimizer and the Minimum Value of a Regression Function under Passive Design","Arya Akhavan, Davit Gogolashvili, Alexandre B. Tsybakov","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-1396/22-1396.pdf","","We propose a new method for estimating the minimizer $\boldsymbol{x}^*$ and the minimum value $f^*$ of a smooth and strongly convex regression function $f$ from the observations contaminated by random noise. Our estimator $\boldsymbol{z}_n$ of the minimizer $\boldsymbol{x}^*$ is based on a version of the projected gradient descent with the gradient estimated by a regularized local polynomial algorithm. Next, we propose a two-stage procedure for estimation of the minimum value $f^*$ of regression function $f$. At the first stage, we construct an accurate enough estimator of $\boldsymbol{x}^*$, which can be, for example, $\boldsymbol{z}_n$. At the second stage, we estimate the function value at the point obtained in the first stage using a rate optimal nonparametric procedure. We derive non-asymptotic upper bounds for the quadratic risk and optimization risk of $\boldsymbol{z}_n$, and for the risk of estimating $f^*$. We establish minimax lower bounds showing that, under certain choice of parameters, the proposed algorithms achieve the minimax optimal rates of convergence  on the class of smooth and strongly convex functions."
"230119","Critically Assessing the State of the Art in Neural Network Verification","Matthias König, Annelot W. Bosman, Holger H. Hoos, Jan N. van Rijn","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0119/23-0119.pdf","","Recent research has proposed various methods to formally verify neural networks against minimal input perturbations; this verification task is also known as local robustness verification. The research area of local robustness verification is highly diverse, as verifiers rely on a multitude of techniques, including mixed integer programming and satisfiability modulo theories. At the same time, the problem instances encountered when performing local robustness verification differ based on the network to be verified, the property to be verified and the specific network input. This raises the question of which verification algorithm is most suitable for solving specific types of instances of the local robustness verification problem. To answer this question, we performed a systematic performance analysis of several CPU- and GPU-based local robustness verification systems on a newly and carefully assembled set of 79 neural networks, of which we verified a broad range of robustness properties, while taking a practitioner's point of view -- a perspective that complements the insights from initiatives such as the VNN competition, where the participating tools are carefully adapted to the given benchmarks by their developers. Notably, we show that no single best algorithm dominates performance across all verification problem instances. Instead, our results reveal complementarities in verifier performance and illustrate the potential of leveraging algorithm portfolios for more efficient local robustness verification. We quantify this complementarity using various performance measures, such as the Shapley value. Furthermore, we confirm the notion that most algorithms only support ReLU-based networks, while other activation functions remain under-supported."
"230237","A Comparison of Continuous-Time Approximations to Stochastic Gradient Descent","Stefan Ankirchner, Stefan Perko","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0237/23-0237.pdf","","Applying a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) method for minimizing an objective gives rise to a discrete-time process of estimated parameter values. In order to better understand the dynamics of the estimated values, many authors have considered continuous-time approximations of SGD. We refine existing results on the weak error of first-order ODE and SDE approximations to SGD for non-infinitesimal learning rates. In particular, we explicitly compute the linear term in the error expansion of gradient flow and two of its stochastic counterparts, with respect to a discretization parameter $h$. In the example of linear regression, we demonstrate the general inferiority of the deterministic gradient flow approximation in comparison to the stochastic ones, for batch sizes which are not too large. Further, we demonstrate that for Gaussian features an SDE approximation with state-independent noise (CC) is preferred over using a state-dependent coefficient (NCC). The same comparison holds true for features of low kurtosis or large batch sizes. However, the relationship reverses for highly leptokurtic features or small batch sizes."
"230356","Improving physics-informed neural networks with meta-learned optimization","Alex Bihlo","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0356/23-0356.pdf","","We show that the error achievable using physics-informed neural networks for solving differential equations can be substantially reduced when these networks are trained using meta-learned optimization methods rather than using fixed, hand-crafted optimizers as traditionally done. We choose a learnable optimization method based on a shallow multi-layer perceptron that is meta-trained for specific classes of differential equations. We illustrate meta-trained optimizers for several equations of practical relevance in mathematical physics, including the linear advection equation, Poisson's equation, the Korteweg-de Vries equation and Burgers' equation. We also illustrate that meta-learned optimizers exhibit transfer learning abilities, in that a meta-trained optimizer on one differential equation can also be successfully deployed on another differential equation."
"230549","On the Effect of Initialization: The Scaling Path of 2-Layer Neural Networks","Sebastian Neumayer, Lénaïc Chizat, Michael Unser","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0549/23-0549.pdf","","In supervised learning, the regularization path is sometimes used as a convenient theoretical proxy for the optimization path of gradient descent initialized from zero. In this paper, we study a modification of the regularization path for infinite-width 2-layer ReLU neural networks with nonzero initial distribution of the weights at different scales. By exploiting a link with unbalanced optimal-transport theory, we show that, despite the non-convexity of the 2-layer network training, this problem admits an infinite-dimensional convex counterpart. We formulate the corresponding functional-optimization problem and investigate its main properties. In particular, we show that, as the scale of the initialization ranges between $0$ and $+\infty$, the associated path interpolates continuously between the so-called kernel and rich regimes. Numerical experiments confirm that, in our setting, the scaling path and the final states of the optimization path behave similarly, even beyond these extreme points."
"230661","Localized Debiased Machine Learning: Efficient Inference on Quantile Treatment Effects and Beyond","Nathan Kallus, Xiaojie Mao, Masatoshi Uehara","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0661/23-0661.pdf","https://github.com/CausalML/LocalizedDebiasedMachineLearning","We consider estimating a low-dimensional parameter in an estimating equation involving high-dimensional nuisance functions that depend on the target parameter as an input. A central example is the efficient estimating equation for the (local) quantile treatment effect ((L)QTE) in causal inference, which involves the covariate-conditional cumulative distribution function evaluated at the quantile to be estimated. Existing approaches based on flexibly estimating the nuisances and plugging in the estimates, such as debiased machine learning (DML), require we learn the nuisance at all possible inputs. For (L)QTE, DML requires we learn the whole covariate-conditional cumulative distribution function. We instead propose localized debiased machine learning (LDML), which avoids this burdensome step and needs only estimate nuisances at a single initial rough guess for the target parameter. For (L)QTE, LDML involves learning just two regression functions, a standard task for machine learning methods. We prove that under lax rate conditions our estimator has the same favorable asymptotic behavior as the infeasible estimator that uses the unknown true nuisances. Thus, LDML notably enables practically-feasible and theoretically-grounded efficient estimation of important quantities in causal inference such as (L)QTEs when we must control for many covariates and/or flexible relationships, as we demonstrate in empirical studies."
"230893","On Sufficient Graphical Models","Bing Li, Kyongwon Kim","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0893/23-0893.pdf","","We introduce a sufficient graphical model by applying the recently developed nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction techniques to the evaluation of conditional independence. The graphical model is nonparametric in nature, as it does not make distributional assumptions such as the Gaussian or copula Gaussian assumptions. However, unlike a fully nonparametric graphical model, which relies on the high-dimensional kernel to characterize conditional independence, our graphical model is based on conditional independence given a set of sufficient predictors with a substantially reduced dimension. In this way we avoid the curse of dimensionality that comes with a high-dimensional kernel. We develop the population-level properties, convergence rate, and variable selection consistency of our estimate. By simulation comparisons and an analysis of the DREAM 4 Challenge data set, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods when the Gaussian or copula Gaussian assumptions are violated, and its performance remains excellent in the high-dimensional setting."

However, its stochastic optimizer lacks clear convergence criteria and requires tuning parameters. Moreover, ADVI inherits the poor posterior uncertainty estimates of mean-field variational Bayes (MFVB).  We introduce ""deterministic ADVI"" (DADVI) to address these issues. DADVI replaces the intractable MFVB objective with a fixed Monte Carlo approximation, a technique known in the stochastic optimization literature as the ""sample average approximation"" (SAA).  By optimizing an approximate but deterministic objective, DADVI can use off-the-shelf second-order optimization, and, unlike standard mean-field ADVI, is amenable to more accurate posterior covariances via linear response (LR).  In contrast to existing worst-case theory, we show that, on certain classes of common statistical problems, DADVI and the SAA can perform well with relatively few samples even in very high dimensions, though we also show that such favorable results cannot extend to variational approximations that are too expressive relative to mean-field ADVI. We show on a variety of real-world problems that DADVI reliably finds good solutions with default settings (unlike ADVI) and, together with LR covariances, is typically faster and more accurate than standard ADVI."

In this paper, we propose a nonparametric testing procedure based on samples quantized to $B$ bits through a computationally efficient algorithm. Under mild technical conditions, we establish the asymptotic properties of the proposed test statistic and investigate how the testing power changes as $B$ increases. In particular, we show that if $B$ exceeds a certain threshold, the proposed nonparametric testing procedure achieves the classical minimax rate of testing (Shang and Cheng, 2015) for spline models. We further extend our theoretical investigations to a nonparametric linearity test and an adaptive nonparametric test, expanding the applicability of the proposed methods. Extensive simulation studies {together with a real-data analysis} are used to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed tests."

(2) Justification for less frequent averaging. (3) That we expect adaptive gradient methods to work equally well, or better, with iterate averaging than their non-adaptive counterparts. Inspired by these results, together with empirical investigations of the importance of appropriate regularisation for the solution diversity of the iterates, we propose two adaptive algorithms with iterate averaging. These give significantly better results compared to stochastic gradient descent (SGD), require less tuning and do not require early stopping or validation set monitoring. We showcase the efficacy of our approach on the CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet and Penn Treebank datasets on a variety of modern and classical network architectures."
"211190","Pursuit of the Cluster Structure of Network Lasso: Recovery Condition and Non-convex Extension","Shotaro Yagishita, Jun-ya Gotoh","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-1190/21-1190.pdf","","Network lasso (NL for short) is a technique for estimating models by simultaneously clustering data samples and fitting the models to them. It often succeeds in forming clusters thanks to the geometry of the sum of $\ell_2$ norm employed therein, but there may be limitations due to the convexity of the regularizer. This paper focuses on clustering generated by NL and strengthens it by creating a non-convex extension, called network trimmed lasso (NTL for short). Specifically, we initially investigate a sufficient condition that guarantees the recovery of the latent cluster structure of NL on the basis of the result of Sun et al. (2021) for convex clustering, which is a special case of NL for ordinary clustering. Second, we extend NL to NTL to incorporate a cardinality (or, $\ell_0$-)constraint and rewrite the constrained optimization problem defined with the $\ell_0$ norm, a discontinuous function, into an equivalent unconstrained continuous optimization problem. We develop ADMM algorithms to solve NTL and show their convergence results. Numerical illustrations indicate that the non-convex extension provides a more clear-cut cluster structure when NL fails to form clusters without incorporating prior knowledge of the associated parameters."

In this work, we first show that there exists a convex loss function for which the stability gap for multiple epochs of SGD with standard heavy-ball momentum (SGDM) becomes unbounded. Then, for smooth Lipschitz loss functions, we analyze a modified momentum-based update rule, i.e., SGD with early momentum (SGDEM) under a broad range of step-sizes, and show that it can train machine learning models for multiple epochs with a guarantee for generalization. Finally, for the special case of strongly convex loss functions, we find a range of momentum such that multiple epochs of standard SGDM, as a special form of SGDEM, also generalizes. Extending our results on generalization, we also develop an upper bound on the expected true risk, in terms of the number of training steps, sample size, and momentum. Our experimental evaluations verify the consistency between the numerical results and our theoretical bounds. SGDEM improves the generalization error of SGDM when training ResNet-18 on ImageNet in practical distributed settings."
"220487","Post-Regularization Confidence Bands for Ordinary Differential Equations","Xiaowu Dai, Lexin Li","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0487/22-0487.pdf","","Ordinary differential equation (ODE) is an important tool to study a system of biological and physical processes. A central question in ODE modeling is to infer the significance of individual regulatory effect of one signal variable on another. However, building confidence band for ODE with unknown regulatory relations is challenging, and it remains largely an open question. In this article, we construct the post-regularization confidence band for the individual regulatory function in ODE with unknown functionals and noisy data observations. Our proposal is the first of its kind, and is built on two novel ingredients. The first is a new localized kernel learning approach that combines reproducing kernel learning with local Taylor approximation, and the second is a new de-biasing method that tackles infinite-dimensional functionals and additional measurement errors. We show that the constructed confidence band has the desired asymptotic coverage probability, and the recovered regulatory network approaches the truth with probability tending to one. We establish the theoretical properties when the number of variables in the system can be either smaller or larger than the number of sampling time points, and we study the regime-switching phenomenon. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method through both simulations and illustrations with two data applications."

Non-asymptotic upper bounds are derived for the generalization error of the empirical risk minimizer over a properly chosen network class.   Under the assumption that the target operator exhibits a low dimensional structure, our error bounds decay as the training sample size increases, with an attractive fast rate depending on the intrinsic dimension in our estimation. Our assumptions cover most scenarios in real applications and our results give rise to fast rates by exploiting low dimensional structures of data in operator estimation. We also investigate the influence of network structures (e.g., network width, depth, and sparsity) on the generalization error of the neural network estimator and propose a general suggestion on the choice of network structures to maximize the learning efficiency quantitatively."
"220846","On Tail Decay Rate Estimation of Loss Function Distributions","Etrit Haxholli, Marco Lorenzi","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0846/22-0846.pdf","https://github.com/ehaxholli/CTE","The study of loss-function distributions is critical to characterize a model's behaviour on a given machine-learning problem. While model quality is commonly measured by the average loss assessed on a testing set, this quantity does not ascertain the existence of the mean of the loss distribution. Conversely, the existence of a distribution's statistical moments can be verified by examining the thickness of its tails. Cross-validation schemes determine a family of testing loss distributions conditioned on the training sets. By marginalizing across training sets, we can recover the overall (marginal) loss distribution, whose tail-shape we aim to estimate. Small sample-sizes diminish the reliability and efficiency of classical tail-estimation methods like Peaks-Over-Threshold, and we demonstrate that this effect is notably significant when estimating tails of marginal distributions composed of conditional distributions with substantial tail-location variability. We mitigate this problem by utilizing a result we prove: under certain conditions, the marginal-distribution's tail-shape parameter is the maximum tail-shape parameter across the conditional distributions underlying the marginal. We label the resulting approach as `cross-tail estimation (CTE)'. We test CTE in a series of experiments on simulated and real data showing the improved robustness and quality of tail estimation as compared to classical approaches."

Within a system, the Gaussian process model needs to perform in a stable and reliable manner to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts of the system. In this work, we study the numerical stability of scalable sparse approximations based on inducing points. To do so, we first review numerical stability, and illustrate typical situations in which Gaussian process models can be unstable. Building on stability theory originally developed in the interpolation literature, we derive sufficient and in certain cases necessary conditions on the inducing points for the computations performed to be numerically stable. For low-dimensional tasks such as geospatial modeling, we propose an automated method for computing inducing points satisfying these conditions. This is done via a modification of the cover tree data structure, which is of independent interest. We additionally propose an alternative sparse approximation for regression with a Gaussian likelihood which trades off a small amount of performance to further improve stability. We provide illustrative examples showing the relationship between stability of calculations and predictive performance of inducing point methods on spatial tasks."

With weight decay regularization and in the infinite neuron, infinite data limit, we prove that a unique radially symmetric minimizer exists, whose average parameters and Lipschitz constant grow as $d$ and $\sqrt{d}$ respectively. We furthermore show that the average weight variable grows exponentially in $d$ if the label $1$ is imposed on a ball of radius $\varepsilon$ rather than just at the origin. By comparison, a neural networks with two hidden layers can approximate the target function without encountering the curse of dimensionality."

For a generic variational family defined using the same backward decomposition as the actual joint smoothing distribution, we establish under mixing assumptions that the variational approximation of expectations of additive state functionals induces an error which grows at most linearly in the number of observations. This guarantee is consistent with the known upper bounds for the approximation of smoothing distributions using standard Monte Carlo methods. We illustrate our theoretical result with state-of-the art variational solutions based both on the backward parameterization and on alternatives using forward decompositions. This numerical study proposes guidelines for variational inference based on neural networks in state-space models."

The advantage of our bound becomes clear in application to nonparametric density estimation. We show that the JS-divergence between the GAN estimate and $\mathsf{p}^*$ decays as fast as $(\log{n}/n)^{2\beta/(2\beta + d)}$, where $n$ is the sample size and $\beta$ determines the smoothness of $\mathsf{p}^*$. This rate of convergence coincides (up to logarithmic factors) with minimax optimal for the considered class of densities."

However, imitation learning methods still require numerous expert demonstration samples to successfully imitate an expert's behavior. To improve sample efficiency, we utilize self-supervised representation learning, which can generate vast training signals from the given data. In this study, we propose a self-supervised representation-based adversarial imitation learning method to learn state and action representations that are robust to diverse distortions and temporally predictive, on non-image control tasks. In particular, in comparison with existing self-supervised learning methods for tabular data, we propose a different corruption method for state and action representations that is robust to diverse distortions. We theoretically and empirically observe that making an informative feature manifold with less sample complexity significantly improves the performance of imitation learning. The proposed method shows a 39% relative improvement over existing adversarial imitation learning methods on MuJoCo in a setting limited to 100 expert state-action pairs. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive ablations and additional experiments using demonstrations with varying optimality to provide insights into a range of factors."

However, many research endeavours heavily rely on parameter sharing among agents, which confines them to only homogeneous-agent setting and leads to training instability and lack of convergence guarantees. To achieve effective cooperation in the general heterogeneous-agent setting, we propose Heterogeneous-Agent Reinforcement Learning (HARL) algorithms that resolve the aforementioned issues. Central to our findings are the multi-agent advantage decomposition lemma and the sequential update scheme. Based on these, we develop the provably correct Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Learning (HATRL), and derive HATRPO and HAPPO by tractable approximations. Furthermore, we discover a novel framework named Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML), which strengthens theoretical guarantees for HATRPO and HAPPO and provides a general template for cooperative MARL algorithmic designs. We prove that all algorithms derived from HAML inherently enjoy monotonic improvement of joint return and convergence to Nash Equilibrium. As its natural outcome, HAML validates more novel algorithms in addition to HATRPO and HAPPO, including HAA2C, HADDPG, and HATD3, which generally outperform their existing MA-counterparts. We comprehensively test HARL algorithms on six challenging benchmarks and demonstrate their superior effectiveness and stability for coordinating heterogeneous agents compared to strong baselines such as MAPPO and QMIX."

A major challenge in policy learning is how to adapt efficiently to unseen environments or tasks. Recently, it has been suggested to exploit invariant conditional distributions to learn models that generalize better to unseen environments. However, assuming invariance of entire conditional distributions (which we call full invariance) may be too strong of an assumption in practice. In this paper, we introduce a relaxation of full invariance called effect-invariance (e-invariance for short) and prove that it is sufficient, under suitable assumptions, for zero-shot policy generalization. We also discuss an extension that exploits e-invariance when we have a small sample from the test environment, enabling few-shot policy generalization. Our work does not assume an underlying causal graph or that the data are generated by a structural causal model; instead, we develop testing procedures to test e-invariance directly from data. We present empirical results using simulated data and a mobile health intervention dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

This finding enables the extension of most approximation results achieved with $\mathtt{ReLU}$ networks to a wide variety of other activation functions, albeit with slightly increased constants.

Tony Cai, Hongji Wei","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-0316/21-0316.pdf","","Distributed estimation of a Gaussian mean under communication constraints is studied in a decision theoretical framework. Minimax rates of convergence, which characterize the tradeoff between communication costs and statistical accuracy, are established under the independent protocols. Communication-efficient and statistically optimal procedures are developed. In the univariate case, the optimal rate depends only on the total communication budget, so long as each local machine has at least one bit. However, in the multivariate case, the minimax rate depends on the specific allocations of the communication budgets among the local machines. Although optimal estimation of a Gaussian mean is relatively simple in the conventional setting, it is quite involved under communication constraints, both in terms of the optimal procedure design and the lower bound argument. An essential step is the decomposition of the minimax estimation problem into two stages, localization and refinement. This critical decomposition provides a framework for both the lower bound analysis and optimal procedure design. The optimality results and techniques developed in the present paper can be useful for solving other problems such as distributed nonparametric function estimation and sparse signal recovery."

"211343","On the Sample Complexity and Metastability of Heavy-tailed Policy Search in Continuous Control","Amrit Singh Bedi, Anjaly Parayil, Junyu Zhang, Mengdi Wang, Alec Koppel","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-1343/21-1343.pdf","","Reinforcement learning is a framework for interactive decision-making with incentives sequentially revealed across time without a system dynamics model. Due to its scaling to continuous spaces, we focus on policy search where one iteratively improves a parameterized policy with stochastic policy gradient (PG) updates. In tabular Markov Decision Problems (MDPs), under persistent exploration and suitable parameterization, global optimality may be obtained. By contrast, in continuous space, the non-convexity poses a pathological challenge as evidenced by existing convergence results being mostly limited to stationarity or arbitrary local extrema. To close this gap, we step towards persistent exploration in continuous space through policy parameterizations defined by distributions of heavier tails defined by tail-index parameter $\alpha$, which increases the likelihood of jumping in state space. Doing so invalidates smoothness conditions of the score function common to PG. Thus, we establish how the convergence rate to stationarity depends on the policy's tail index $\alpha$, a Hölder continuity parameter, integrability conditions, and an exploration tolerance parameter introduced here for the first time. Further, we characterize the dependence of the set of local maxima on the tail index through an exit and transition time analysis of a suitably defined Markov chain, identifying that policies associated with Lévy Processes of a heavier tail converge to wider peaks. This phenomenon yields improved stability to perturbations in supervised learning, which we corroborate also manifests in improved performance of policy search, especially when myopic and farsighted incentives are misaligned."

Chen","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0667/22-0667.pdf","https://github.com/georgehc/survival-kernets","Kernel survival analysis models estimate individual survival distributions with the help of a kernel function, which measures the similarity between any two data points. Such a kernel function can be learned using deep kernel survival models. In this paper, we present a new deep kernel survival model called a survival kernet, which scales to large datasets in a manner that is amenable to model interpretation and also theoretical analysis. Specifically, the training data are partitioned into clusters based on a recently developed training set compression scheme for classification and regression called kernel netting that we extend to the survival analysis setting. At test time, each data point is represented as a weighted combination of these clusters, and each such cluster can be visualized. For a special case of survival kernets, we establish a finite-sample error bound on predicted survival distributions that is, up to a log factor, optimal. Whereas scalability at test time is achieved using the aforementioned kernel netting compression strategy, scalability during training is achieved by a warm-start procedure based on tree ensembles such as XGBoost and a heuristic approach to accelerating neural architecture search. On four standard survival analysis datasets of varying sizes (up to roughly 3 million data points), we show that survival kernets are highly competitive compared to various baselines tested in terms of time-dependent concordance index.

When data are collected from different sources with heterogeneous trends while still sharing some congruency, it is critical to extract shared knowledge while retaining the unique features of each source. To this end, we propose personalized PCA  (PerPCA), which uses mutually orthogonal global and local principal components to encode both unique and shared features. We show that, under mild conditions, both unique and shared features can be identified and recovered by a constrained optimization problem, even if the covariance matrices are immensely different. Also, we design a fully federated algorithm inspired by distributed Stiefel gradient descent to solve the problem. The algorithm introduces a new group of operations called generalized retractions to handle orthogonality constraints, and only requires global PCs to be shared across sources. We prove the linear convergence of the algorithm under suitable assumptions. Comprehensive numerical experiments highlight PerPCA's superior performance in feature extraction and prediction from heterogeneous datasets. As a systematic approach to decouple shared and unique features from heterogeneous datasets, PerPCA finds applications in several tasks, including video segmentation, topic extraction, and feature clustering."

Our focus is on transforming deep neural networks using Reynolds operators, which average over the group to convert a function into an invariant or equivariant form. While learning methods based on Reynolds operators are well-established, they often face computational complexity challenges. To address this, we introduce two new methods that reduce the computational burden associated with the Reynolds operator: (i) Although the Reynolds operator traditionally averages over the entire group, we demonstrate that it can be effectively approximated by averaging over specific subsets of the group, termed the Reynolds design. (ii) We reveal that the pre-model does not require all input variables. Instead, using a select number of partial inputs (Reynolds dimension) is sufficient to achieve a universally applicable model. Employing these methods, which hinge on the Reynolds design and Reynolds dimension concepts, allows us to construct universally applicable models with manageable computational complexity. Our experiments on benchmark data indicate that our approach is more efficient than existing methods."

In this paper, we investigate the multiple descent phenomenon in a class of multi-component prediction models. We first consider a ""double random feature model"" (DRFM) concatenating two types of random features, and study the excess risk achieved by the DRFM in ridge regression. We calculate the precise limit of the excess risk under the high dimensional framework where the training sample size, the dimension of data, and the dimension of random features tend to infinity proportionally. Based on the calculation, we further theoretically demonstrate that the risk curves of DRFMs can exhibit triple descent. We then provide a thorough experimental study to verify our theory. At last, we extend our study to the ""multiple random feature model"" (MRFM), and show that MRFMs ensembling $K$ types of random features may exhibit $(K+1)$-fold descent. Our analysis points out that risk curves with a specific number of descent generally exist in learning multi-component prediction models."

In contrast, we propose to train generative networks to minimize a predictive-sequential (or prequential) scoring rule on a recorded temporal sequence of the phenomenon of interest, which is appealing as it corresponds to the way forecasting systems are routinely evaluated. Adversarial-free minimization is possible for some scoring rules; hence, our framework avoids the cumbersome hyperparameter tuning and uncertainty underestimation due to unstable adversarial training, thus unlocking reliable use of generative networks in probabilistic forecasting. Further, we prove consistency of the minimizer of our objective with dependent data, while adversarial training assumes independence. We perform simulation studies on two chaotic dynamical models and a benchmark data set of global weather observations; for this last example, we define scoring rules for spatial data by drawing from the relevant literature. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art adversarial approaches, especially in probabilistic calibration, while requiring less hyperparameter tuning."

Consequently, they formulate the learning task as finding a partition in which the nearest neighbors of a query point belong to the same partition element with it as often as possible. In contrast, we formulate the candidate set selection in ANN search directly as a multilabel classification problem where the labels correspond to the nearest neighbors of the query point. In the proposed framework,  partition-based index structures are interpreted as partitioning classifiers for solving this classification problem. Empirical results suggest that, when combined with any partitioning strategy, the natural classifier based on the proposed framework leads to a strictly improved performance compared to the earlier candidate set selection methods.  We also prove a sufficient condition for the consistency of a partitioning classifier for ANN search, and illustrate the result by verifying this condition for chronological $k$-d trees and (both dense and sparse) random projection trees."

Although it is beneficial to learn from more modalities, it is often infeasible to use all available modalities under limited computational resources. Modeling with all available modalities can also be inefficient and unnecessary when information across input modalities overlaps. In this paper, we study the modality selection problem, which aims to select the most useful subset of modalities for learning under a cardinality constraint. To that end, we propose a unified theoretical framework to quantify the learning utility of modalities, and we identify dependence assumptions to flexibly model the heterogeneous nature of multimodal data, which also allows efficient algorithm design. Accordingly, we derive a greedy modality selection algorithm via submodular maximization, which selects the most useful modalities with an optimality guarantee on learning performance. We also connect marginal-contribution-based feature importance scores, such as Shapley value, from the feature selection domain to the context of modality selection, to efficiently compute the importance of individual modality. We demonstrate the efficacy of our theoretical results and modality selection algorithms on 2 synthetic and 4 real-world data sets on a diverse range of multimodal data."

"231042","Trained Transformers Learn Linear Models In-Context","Ruiqi Zhang, Spencer Frei, Peter L. Bartlett","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-1042/23-1042.pdf","","Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have demonstrated a remarkable ability to exhibit in-context learning (ICL): Given a short prompt sequence of tokens from an unseen task, they can formulate relevant per-token and next-token predictions without any parameter updates.  By embedding a sequence of labeled training data and unlabeled test data as a prompt, this allows for transformers to behave like supervised learning algorithms. Indeed, recent work has shown that when training transformer architectures over random instances of linear regression problems, these models' predictions mimic those of ordinary least squares. Towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we investigate the dynamics of ICL in transformers with a single linear self-attention layer trained by gradient flow on linear regression tasks.  We show that despite non-convexity, gradient flow with a suitable random initialization finds a global minimum of the objective function.  At this global minimum, when given a test prompt of labeled examples from a new prediction task, the transformer achieves prediction error competitive with the best linear predictor over the test prompt distribution. We additionally characterize the robustness of the trained transformer to a variety of distribution shifts and show that although a number of shifts are tolerated, shifts in the covariate distribution of the prompts are not.  Motivated by this, we consider a generalized ICL setting where the covariate distributions can vary across prompts. We show that although gradient flow succeeds at finding a global minimum in this setting, the trained transformer is still brittle under mild covariate shifts. We complement this finding with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures which we show are more robust under covariate shifts."
"19301","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/19-301/19-301.pdf","","Ideal supervised classification assumes known correct labels, but various truthing issues can arise in practice: noisy labels; multiple, conflicting labels for a sample; missing labels; and different labeler combinations for different samples. Previous work introduced a noisy-label model, which views the observed noisy labels as random variables conditioned on the unobserved correct labels. It has mainly focused on estimating the conditional distribution of the noisy labels and the class prior, as well as estimating the correct labels or training with noisy labels. In a complementary manner, given the conditional distribution and class prior, we apply estimation theory to classifier testing, training, and comparison of different combinations of labelers. First, for binary classification, we construct a testing model and derive approximate marginal posteriors for accuracy, precision, recall, probability of false alarm, and F-score, and joint posteriors for ROC and precision-recall analysis.  We propose minimum mean-square error (MMSE) testing, which employs empirical Bayes algorithms to estimate the testing-model parameters and then computes optimal point estimates and credible regions for the metrics. We extend the approach to multi-class classification to obtain optimal estimates of accuracy and individual confusion-matrix elements. Second, we present a unified view of training that covers probabilistic (i.e., discriminative or generative) and non-probabilistic models.  For the former, we adjust maximum-likelihood or maximum a posteriori training for truthing issues; for the latter, we propose MMSE training, which minimizes the MMSE estimate of the empirical risk. We also describe suboptimal training that is compatible with existing infrastructure. Third, we observe that mutual information lets one express any labeler combination as an equivalent single labeler, implying that multiple mediocre labelers can be as informative as, or more informative than, a single expert labeler.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods and confirm the implication."
"210264","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-0264/21-0264.pdf","","In this paper we study the lower complexity bounds for finite-sum optimization problems, where the objective is the average of $n$ individual component functions. We consider a so-called proximal incremental first-order oracle (PIFO) algorithm, which employs the individual component function's gradient and proximal information provided by PIFO to update the variable. To incorporate loopless methods, we also allow the PIFO algorithm to obtain the full gradient infrequently. We develop a novel approach to constructing the hard instances, which partitions the tridiagonal matrix of classical examples into $n$ groups. This construction is friendly to the analysis of PIFO algorithms. Based on this construction, we establish the lower complexity bounds for finite-sum minimax optimization problems when the objective is convex-concave or nonconvex-strongly-concave and the class of component functions is $L$-average smooth. Most of these bounds are nearly matched by existing upper bounds up to log factors.

By considering various combinations of the three components, we obtain a collection of variants of knockoff. All these variants guarantee finite-sample FDR control, and our goal is to compare their power. We assume a Rare and Weak signal model on regression coeffi- cients and compare the power of different variants of knockoff by deriving explicit formulas of false positive rate and false negative rate. Our results provide new insights on how to improve power when controlling FDR at a targeted level. We also compare the power of knockoff with its propotype - a method that uses the same ranking algorithm but has access to an ideal threshold. The comparison reveals the additional price one pays by finding a data-driven threshold to control FDR."

Despite recent efforts in understanding the last-iterate convergence of extragradient methods in the unconstrained setting, the theoretical underpinnings of these methods in the constrained settings, especially those using multiplicative updates, remain highly inadequate, even when the objective function is bilinear. Motivated by the algorithmic role of entropy regularization in single-agent reinforcement learning and game theory, we develop provably efficient extragradient methods to find the quantal response equilibrium (QRE)---which are solutions to zero-sum two-player matrix games with entropy regularization---at a linear rate. The proposed algorithms can be implemented in a decentralized manner, where each player executes symmetric and multiplicative updates iteratively using its own payoff without observing the opponent's actions directly. In addition, by controlling the knob of entropy regularization, the proposed algorithms can locate an approximate Nash equilibrium of the unregularized matrix game at a sublinear rate without assuming the Nash equilibrium to be unique. Our methods also lead to efficient policy extragradient algorithms for solving (entropy-regularized) zero-sum Markov games at similar rates. All of our convergence rates are nearly dimension-free, which are independent of the size of the state and action spaces up to logarithm factors, highlighting the positive role of entropy regularization for accelerating convergence."

We assume in this work that the observed pair $G,H$ has been drawn from the Correlated Gaussian Wigner (CGW) model -- a popular model for correlated weighted graphs -- where the entries of the adjacency matrices of $G$ and $H$ are independent Gaussians and each edge of $G$ is correlated with one edge of $H$ (determined by the unknown matching) with the edge correlation  described by a parameter $\sigma \in [0,1)$. In this paper, we analyse the performance of the projected power method (PPM) as a seeded graph matching algorithm where we are given an initial partially correct matching (called the seed) as side information. We prove that if the seed is close enough to the ground-truth matching, then with high probability, PPM iteratively improves the seed and recovers the ground-truth matching (either partially or exactly) in $O(\log n)$ iterations. Our results prove that PPM works even in regimes of constant $\sigma$, thus extending the analysis in (Mao et al., 2023) for the sparse Correlated Erdos-Renyi (CER) model to the (dense) CGW model. As a byproduct of our analysis, we see that the PPM framework generalizes some of the state-of-art algorithms for seeded graph matching.

A popular approach is to define a variable importance parameter --- known as LOCO (Leave Out COvariates) --- based on dropping covariates from a regression model.  This is essentially a nonparametric version of $R^2$. This parameter is very general and can be estimated nonparametrically, but it can be hard to interpret because it is affected by correlation between covariates.

At the same time, the problem instances encountered when performing local robustness verification differ based on the network to be verified, the property to be verified and the specific network input. This raises the question of which verification algorithm is most suitable for solving specific types of instances of the local robustness verification problem. To answer this question, we performed a systematic performance analysis of several CPU- and GPU-based local robustness verification systems on a newly and carefully assembled set of 79 neural networks, of which we verified a broad range of robustness properties, while taking a practitioner's point of view -- a perspective that complements the insights from initiatives such as the VNN competition, where the participating tools are carefully adapted to the given benchmarks by their developers. Notably, we show that no single best algorithm dominates performance across all verification problem instances. Instead, our results reveal complementarities in verifier performance and illustrate the potential of leveraging algorithm portfolios for more efficient local robustness verification. We quantify this complementarity using various performance measures, such as the Shapley value. Furthermore, we confirm the notion that most algorithms only support ReLU-based networks, while other activation functions remain under-supported."

Based on these, we develop the provably correct Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Learning (HATRL), and derive HATRPO and HAPPO by tractable approximations. Furthermore, we discover a novel framework named Heterogeneous-Agent Mirror Learning (HAML), which strengthens theoretical guarantees for HATRPO and HAPPO and provides a general template for cooperative MARL algorithmic designs. We prove that all algorithms derived from HAML inherently enjoy monotonic improvement of joint return and convergence to Nash Equilibrium. As its natural outcome, HAML validates more novel algorithms in addition to HATRPO and HAPPO, including HAA2C, HADDPG, and HATD3, which generally outperform their existing MA-counterparts. We comprehensively test HARL algorithms on six challenging benchmarks and demonstrate their superior effectiveness and stability for coordinating heterogeneous agents compared to strong baselines such as MAPPO and QMIX."

A major challenge in policy learning is how to adapt efficiently to unseen environments or tasks. Recently, it has been suggested to exploit invariant conditional distributions to learn models that generalize better to unseen environments. However, assuming invariance of entire conditional distributions (which we call full invariance) may be too strong of an assumption in practice. In this paper, we introduce a relaxation of full invariance called effect-invariance (e-invariance for short) and prove that it is sufficient, under suitable assumptions, for zero-shot policy generalization. We also discuss an extension that exploits e-invariance when we have a small sample from the test environment, enabling few-shot policy generalization. Our work does not assume an underlying causal graph or that the data are generated by a structural causal model; instead, we develop testing procedures to test e-invariance directly from data. We present empirical results using simulated data and a mobile health intervention dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

Minimax rates of convergence, which characterize the tradeoff between communication costs and statistical accuracy, are established under the independent protocols. Communication-efficient and statistically optimal procedures are developed. In the univariate case, the optimal rate depends only on the total communication budget, so long as each local machine has at least one bit. However, in the multivariate case, the minimax rate depends on the specific allocations of the communication budgets among the local machines. Although optimal estimation of a Gaussian mean is relatively simple in the conventional setting, it is quite involved under communication constraints, both in terms of the optimal procedure design and the lower bound argument. An essential step is the decomposition of the minimax estimation problem into two stages, localization and refinement. This critical decomposition provides a framework for both the lower bound analysis and optimal procedure design. The optimality results and techniques developed in the present paper can be useful for solving other problems such as distributed nonparametric function estimation and sparse signal recovery."

"211343","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/21-1343/21-1343.pdf","","Reinforcement learning is a framework for interactive decision-making with incentives sequentially revealed across time without a system dynamics model. Due to its scaling to continuous spaces, we focus on policy search where one iteratively improves a parameterized policy with stochastic policy gradient (PG) updates. In tabular Markov Decision Problems (MDPs), under persistent exploration and suitable parameterization, global optimality may be obtained. By contrast, in continuous space, the non-convexity poses a pathological challenge as evidenced by existing convergence results being mostly limited to stationarity or arbitrary local extrema. To close this gap, we step towards persistent exploration in continuous space through policy parameterizations defined by distributions of heavier tails defined by tail-index parameter $\alpha$, which increases the likelihood of jumping in state space. Doing so invalidates smoothness conditions of the score function common to PG. Thus, we establish how the convergence rate to stationarity depends on the policy's tail index $\alpha$, a Hölder continuity parameter, integrability conditions, and an exploration tolerance parameter introduced here for the first time. Further, we characterize the dependence of the set of local maxima on the tail index through an exit and transition time analysis of a suitably defined Markov chain, identifying that policies associated with Lévy Processes of a heavier tail converge to wider peaks. This phenomenon yields improved stability to perturbations in supervised learning, which we corroborate also manifests in improved performance of policy search, especially when myopic and farsighted incentives are misaligned."

Such a kernel function can be learned using deep kernel survival models. In this paper, we present a new deep kernel survival model called a survival kernet, which scales to large datasets in a manner that is amenable to model interpretation and also theoretical analysis. Specifically, the training data are partitioned into clusters based on a recently developed training set compression scheme for classification and regression called kernel netting that we extend to the survival analysis setting. At test time, each data point is represented as a weighted combination of these clusters, and each such cluster can be visualized. For a special case of survival kernets, we establish a finite-sample error bound on predicted survival distributions that is, up to a log factor, optimal. Whereas scalability at test time is achieved using the aforementioned kernel netting compression strategy, scalability during training is achieved by a warm-start procedure based on tree ensembles such as XGBoost and a heuristic approach to accelerating neural architecture search. On four standard survival analysis datasets of varying sizes (up to roughly 3 million data points), we show that survival kernets are highly competitive compared to various baselines tested in terms of time-dependent concordance index.

While learning methods based on Reynolds operators are well-established, they often face computational complexity challenges. To address this, we introduce two new methods that reduce the computational burden associated with the Reynolds operator: (i) Although the Reynolds operator traditionally averages over the entire group, we demonstrate that it can be effectively approximated by averaging over specific subsets of the group, termed the Reynolds design. (ii) We reveal that the pre-model does not require all input variables. Instead, using a select number of partial inputs (Reynolds dimension) is sufficient to achieve a universally applicable model.

By embedding a sequence of labeled training data and unlabeled test data as a prompt, this allows for transformers to behave like supervised learning algorithms. Indeed, recent work has shown that when training transformer architectures over random instances of linear regression problems, these models' predictions mimic those of ordinary least squares. Towards understanding the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we investigate the dynamics of ICL in transformers with a single linear self-attention layer trained by gradient flow on linear regression tasks.  We show that despite non-convexity, gradient flow with a suitable random initialization finds a global minimum of the objective function.  At this global minimum, when given a test prompt of labeled examples from a new prediction task, the transformer achieves prediction error competitive with the best linear predictor over the test prompt distribution. We additionally characterize the robustness of the trained transformer to a variety of distribution shifts and show that although a number of shifts are tolerated, shifts in the covariate distribution of the prompts are not.  Motivated by this, we consider a generalized ICL setting where the covariate distributions can vary across prompts. We show that although gradient flow succeeds at finding a global minimum in this setting, the trained transformer is still brittle under mild covariate shifts. We complement this finding with experiments on large, nonlinear transformer architectures which we show are more robust under covariate shifts."

While a tighter linear relaxation for piecewise-linear activations exists, it comes at the cost of exponentially many constraints and currently lacks an efficient customized solver. We alleviate this deficiency by presenting two novel dual algorithms: one operates a subgradient method on a small active set of dual variables, the other exploits the sparsity of Frank-Wolfe type optimizers to incur only a linear memory cost. Both methods recover the strengths of the new relaxation: tightness and a linear separation oracle. At the same time, they share the benefits of previous dual approaches for weaker relaxations: massive parallelism, GPU implementation, low cost per iteration and valid bounds at any time. As a consequence, we can obtain better bounds than off-the-shelf solvers in only a fraction of their running time, attaining significant formal verification speed-ups."

In this approach, one embeds each of the finitely many predictions (e.g. rankings) as a point in $\mathbb{R}^d$, assigns the original loss values to these points, and “convexifies” the loss in some way to obtain a surrogate. We establish a strong connection between this approach and polyhedral (piecewise-linear convex) surrogate losses: every discrete loss is embedded by some polyhedral loss, and every polyhedral loss embeds some discrete loss. Moreover, an embedding gives rise to a consistent link function as well as linear surrogate regret bounds. Our results are constructive, as we illustrate with several examples. In particular, our framework gives succinct proofs of consistency or inconsistency for existing polyhedral surrogates, and for inconsistent surrogates, it further reveals the discrete losses for which these surrogates are consistent. We go on to show additional structure of embeddings, such as the equivalence of embedding and matching Bayes risks, and the equivalence of various notions of non-redudancy. Using these results, we establish that indirect elicitation, a necessary condition for consistency, is also sufficient when working with polyhedral surrogates."

Selectively choosing the contents to be shown on the user's feed may yield a certain extent of influence, either minor or major, on the user's decision-making, compared to what it would have been under a natural/fair content selection. As we have witnessed over the past decade, algorithmic filtering can cause detrimental side effects, ranging from biasing individual decisions to shaping those of society as a whole, for example, diverting users' attention from whether to get the COVID-19 vaccine or inducing the public to choose a presidential candidate. The government's constant attempts to regulate the adverse effects of AF are often complicated, due to bureaucracy, legal affairs, and financial considerations. On the other hand SMPs seek to monitor their own algorithmic activities to avoid being fined for exceeding the allowable threshold. In this paper, we mathematically formalize this framework and utilize it to construct a data-driven statistical auditing procedure to regulate AF from deflecting users' beliefs over time, along with sample complexity guarantees. This state-of-the-art algorithm can be used either by authorities acting as external regulators or by SMPs for self-auditing."

We focus on a family of coloured Gaussian graphical models specifically suited for the paired data problem. Commonly, graphical models are ordered by the submodel relationship so that the search space is a lattice, called the model inclusion lattice. We introduce a novel order between models, named the twin order. We show that, embedded with this order, the model space is a lattice that, unlike the model inclusion lattice, is distributive. Furthermore, we provide the relevant rules for the computation of the neighbours of a model. The latter are more efficient than the same operations in the model inclusion lattice, and are then exploited to achieve a more efficient exploration of the search space. These results can be applied to improve the efficiency of both greedy and Bayesian model search procedures. Here, we implement a stepwise backward elimination procedure and evaluate its performance both on synthetic and real-world data."

Certain reproducing kernel Banach spaces (RKBSs) are appropriate hypothesis spaces for sparse learning methods. The goal of this paper is to understand what kind of RKBSs can promote sparsity for learning solutions. We consider two typical learning models in an RKBS: the minimum norm interpolation (MNI) problem and the regularization problem. We first establish an explicit representer theorem for solutions of these problems, which represents the extreme points of the solution set by a linear combination of the extreme points of the subdifferential set, of the norm function, which is data-dependent. We then propose sufficient conditions on the RKBS that can transform the explicit representation of the solutions to a sparse kernel representation having fewer terms than the number of the observed data. Under the proposed sufficient conditions, we investigate the role of the regularization parameter on sparsity of the regularized solutions. We further show that two specific RKBSs, the sequence space $\ell_1(\mathbb{N})$ and the measure space, can have sparse representer theorems for both MNI and regularization models."

However, there remain two significant gaps between theory and practice. First, the existing convergence theory only takes into account the contribution of the NTK from the last hidden layer, while in practice the intermediate layers also play an instrumental role. Second, most existing works assume that the training data are provided a priori in a batch, while less attention has been paid to the important setting where the training data arrive in a stream. In this paper, we close these two gaps. We first show that with random initialization, the NTK function  converges to some deterministic function uniformly for all layers as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then we apply the uniform convergence result to further prove that the prediction error of multi-layer neural networks under SGD converges in expectation in the streaming data setting. A key ingredient in our proof is to show the number of activation patterns of an $L$-layer neural network with width $m$ is only polynomial in $m$ although there are $mL$ neurons in total."

Unlike current approaches, our methods avoid working with U and V-statistics expansions that usually lead to lengthy and tedious computations and asymptotic approximations. Instead, we work directly with random functionals on the Hilbert space to analyse kernel-based tests. By harnessing the use of random functionals, our framework leads to much cleaner analyses, involving less tedious computations. Additionally, it offers the advantage of accommodating pre-existing knowledge regarding test-statistics as many of the random functionals considered in applications are known statistics that have been studied comprehensively. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we thoroughly examine two categories of kernel tests, along with three specific examples of kernel tests, including a novel kernel test for conditional independence testing."

Building on the work of Ferri et al we assume the learner to be parameterized by priors $P(c)$ and by $c$-conditional likelihoods $P(z|c)$ where $c$ ranges over all concepts in a given class $C$ and $z$ ranges over all observations in an observation set $Z$. $L$ is called a MAP-learner (resp.~an MLE-learner) if it thinks of a collection $S$ of observations as a random sample and returns the concept with the maximum a-posteriori probability (resp.~the concept which maximizes the $c$-conditional likelihood of $S$). Depending on whether $L$ assumes that $S$ is obtained from ordered or unordered sampling resp.~from sampling with or without replacement, we can distinguish four different sampling modes. Given a target concept $c^* \in C$, a teacher for a MAP-learner $L$ aims at finding a smallest collection of observations that causes $L$ to return $c^*$. This approach leads in a natural manner to various notions of a MAP- or MLE-teaching dimension of a concept class $C$. Our main results are as follows. First, we show that this teaching model has some desirable monotonicity properties. Second we clarify how the four sampling modes are related to each other. As for the (important!) special case, where concepts are subsets of a domain and observations are 0,1-labeled examples, we obtain some additional results. First of all, we characterize the MAP- and MLE-teaching dimension associated with an optimally parameterized MAP-learner graph-theoretically. From this central result, some other ones are easy to derive. It is shown, for instance, that the MLE-teaching dimension is either equal to the MAP-teaching dimension or exceeds the latter by $1$. It is shown furthermore that these dimensions can be bounded from above by the so-called antichain number, the VC-dimension and related combinatorial parameters.

Let $T$ be the time horizon and $P_T$ be the path length that essentially reflects the non-stationarity of environments, the state-of-the-art dynamic regret is $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T(1+P_T)})$. Although this bound is proved to be minimax optimal for convex functions, in this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to further enhance the guarantee for some easy problem instances, particularly when online functions are smooth. Specifically, we introduce novel online algorithms that can exploit smoothness and replace the dependence on $T$ in dynamic regret with problem-dependent quantities: the variation in gradients of loss functions, the cumulative loss of the comparator sequence, and the minimum of these two terms. These quantities are at most $\mathcal{O}(T)$ while could be much smaller in benign environments. Therefore, our results are adaptive to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem, since the bounds are tighter than existing results for easy problems and meanwhile safeguard the same rate in the worst case. Notably, our proposed algorithms can achieve favorable dynamic regret with only one gradient per iteration, sharing the same gradient query complexity as the static regret minimization methods. To accomplish this, we introduce the collaborative online ensemble framework. The proposed framework employs a two-layer online ensemble to handle non-stationarity, and uses optimistic online learning and further introduces crucial correction terms to enable effective collaboration within the meta-base two layers, thereby attaining adaptivity. We believe the framework can be useful for broader problems."

The max $K$-armed bandit (MKB) problem, which aims to acquire the single best reward, matches with the discovery tasks better than the conventional bandit. However, typical MKB algorithms are not directly applicable to materials discovery due to some difficulties. The typical algorithms have many hyperparameters and some difficulty in the directly implementation for the materials discovery. Thus, we propose a new MKB algorithm using  an upper confidence bound of expected improvement of the best reward. This approach is guaranteed to be asymptotic to greedy oracles, which does not depend on the time horizon. In addition, compared with other MKB algorithms, the proposed algorithm has only one hyperparameter, which is advantageous in materials discovery. We applied the proposed algorithm to synthetic problems and molecular-design demonstrations using a Monte Carlo tree search. According to the results, the proposed algorithm stably outperformed other bandit algorithms in the late stage of the search process, unless the optimal arm coincides in the MKB and conventional bandit settings."

In the first part of the paper, we study the case where the population risk function satisfies the Tysbakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$. Specifically, we first show that under some mild assumptions on the loss functions, there is an algorithm whose output could achieve an upper bound of $\tilde{O}((\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{d}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}) $ and $\tilde{O}((\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+\frac{\sqrt{d\log(1/\delta)}}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1})$ for $\epsilon$-DP and $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, respectively when $\theta\geq 2$, where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the dimension of the space. Then we address the inefficiency issue, improve the upper bounds by $\text{Poly}(\log n)$ factors and extend to the case where $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}>1$ for some known $\bar{\theta}$. Next, we show that the excess population risk of population functions satisfying TNC with parameter $\theta\geq 2$ is always lower bounded by  $\Omega((\frac{d}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}) $ and $\Omega((\frac{\sqrt{d\log(1/\delta)}}{n\epsilon})^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1})$ for $\epsilon$-DP and $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP, respectively, which matches our upper bounds.

With these additional assumptions, we propose a new method whose output could achieve an upper bound of $O(\frac{d\log(1/\delta)}{n^2\epsilon^2}+\frac{1}{n^{\tau}})$ and $O(\frac{d^2}{n^2\epsilon^2}+\frac{1}{n^{\tau}})$ for any $\tau> 1$ in $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and $\epsilon$-DP model respectively if the sample size $n$ is sufficiently large.

Specifically, we first prove that when training with full preferences on a discrete property, the learned distribution of GARNet rigorously coincides with the distribution specified by the given score vector based on user preferences. The theoretical results are then extended to partial preferences on a discrete property and further generalized to preferences on a continuous property. Meanwhile, numerous experiments show that GARNet can retrieve the distribution of user-desired data based on full/partial preferences in terms of various interested properties (i.e., discrete/continuous property, single/multiple properties).

We refute this conjecture by providing a faster algorithm that has complexity $O(d\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, which is optimal (up to numerical constants) with respect to $d$ and also optimal with respect to the accuracy parameters $\delta,\epsilon$, thus solving an open question due to Lin et al.

"220049","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-0049/22-0049.pdf","","Deep neural networks (DNNs) trained with the logistic loss (also known as the cross entropy loss) have made impressive advancements in various binary classification tasks. Despite the considerable success in practice, generalization analysis for binary classification with deep neural networks and the logistic loss remains scarce. The unboundedness of the target function for the logistic loss in binary classification is the main obstacle to deriving satisfactory generalization bounds. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by developing a novel theoretical analysis and using it to establish tight generalization bounds for training fully connected ReLU DNNs with logistic loss in binary classification. Our generalization analysis is based on an elegant oracle-type inequality which enables us to deal with the boundedness restriction of the target function. Using this oracle-type inequality, we establish generalization bounds for fully connected ReLU DNN  classifiers $\hat{f}^{\text{FNN}}_n$ trained by empirical logistic risk minimization with respect to i.i.d. samples of size $n$, which lead to sharp rates of convergence as $n\to\infty$.  In particular,  we obtain optimal convergence rates for $\hat{f}^{\text{FNN}}_n$ (up to some logarithmic factor) only requiring the Hölder smoothness of the conditional class probability $\eta$ of data. Moreover, we consider a compositional assumption that requires $\eta$ to be the composition of several vector-valued multivariate functions of which each component function is either a maximum value function or a Hölder smooth function only depending on a small number of its input variables. Under this assumption, we can even derive optimal convergence rates for $\hat{f}^{\text{FNN}}_n$ (up to some logarithmic factor) which are independent of the input dimension of data. This result explains why in practice DNN classifiers can overcome the curse of dimensionality and perform well in high-dimensional classification problems. Furthermore, we establish dimension-free rates of convergence under other circumstances such as when the decision boundary is piecewise smooth and the input data are bounded away from it. Besides the novel oracle-type inequality, the sharp convergence rates presented in our paper also owe to a tight error bound for approximating the natural logarithm function near zero (where it is unbounded) by ReLU DNNs. In addition, we justify our claims for the optimality of rates by proving corresponding minimax lower bounds.  All these results are new in the literature and will deepen our theoretical understanding of classification with deep neural networks."

Under the alternative, there is a subgraph on $k$ vertices with edge probability $p>q$. The statistical as well as the computational barriers of this problem are well-understood for a wide range of the edge parameters $p$ and $q$.

For many chronic diseases including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), treatments are usually multifaceted in the sense that aggressive treatments with a higher expected reward are also likely to elevate the risk of acute adverse events. In this paper, we propose a new weighted learning framework, namely benefit-risk dynamic treatment regimens (BR-DTRs), to address the benefit-risk trade-off. The new framework relies on a backward learning procedure by restricting the induced risk of the treatment rule to be no larger than a pre-specified risk constraint at each treatment stage. Computationally, the estimated treatment rule solves a weighted support vector machine problem with a modified smooth constraint. Theoretically, we show that the proposed DTRs are Fisher consistent, and we further obtain the convergence rates for both the value and risk functions. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and application to a real study for T2D patients."

While a shorter conference version of this work already alluded to these nuances, it focused on the binary case and thus failed to be conclusive as to the source of difficulty in the multi-class setting: we show here that it suffices that the Bayes classifier fails to be unique, as opposed to needing all classes to be Bayes optimal, for active learning to yield no gain over passive learning."

Because the linear-Gaussian assumption is restrictive, for very high dimensional problems, they have been replaced by robust, sparse extensions or more flexible discrete-continuous latent feature models. Discrete-continuous latent feature models specify a dictionary of features dependent on subsets of the data and then infer the likelihood that each data point shares any of these features. This is often achieved using rich-get-richer assumptions about the feature allocation process where the dictionary tries to couple the feature frequency with the portion of total variance that it explains. In this work, we propose an alternative approach that allows for better control over the feature to data point allocation. This new approach is based on two-parameter discrete distribution models which decouple feature sparsity and dictionary size, hence capturing both common and rare features in a parsimonious way. The new framework is used to derive a novel adaptive variant of factor analysis (aFA), as well as an adaptive probabilistic principal component analysis (aPPCA) capable of flexible structure discovery and dimensionality reduction in a wide variety of scenarios.

In this paper, we frame this task, often referred to as “fairness auditing,”  in terms of multiple hypothesis testing. We show how the bootstrap can be used to simultaneously bound performance disparities over a collection of groups with statistical guarantees. Our methods can be used to flag subpopulations affected by model underperformance, and certify subpopulations for which the model performs adequately. Crucially, our audit is model-agnostic and applicable to nearly any performance metric or group fairness criterion. Our methods also accommodate extremely rich---even infinite---collections of subpopulations. Further, we generalize beyond subpopulations by showing how to assess performance over certain distribution shifts. We test the proposed methods on benchmark datasets in predictive inference and algorithmic fairness and find that our audits can provide interpretable and trustworthy guarantees."

Simultaneously grouping the two types of nodes in a bipartite graph via biclustering represents a fundamental challenge in network analysis for such graphs. The latent block model (LBM) is a commonly used model-based tool for biclustering. However, the effectiveness of the LBM is often limited by the influence of row and column sums in the data matrix. To address this limitation, we introduce the degree-corrected latent block model (DC-LBM), which accounts for the varying degrees in row and column clusters, significantly enhancing performance on real-world data sets and simulated data. We develop an efficient variational expectation-maximization algorithm by creating closed-form solutions for parameter estimates in the M steps. Furthermore, we prove the label consistency and the rate of convergence of the variational estimator under the DC-LBM, allowing the expected graph density to approach zero as long as the average expected degrees of rows and columns approach infinity when the size of the graph increases."

Moreover, with $m=\Omega(\log^{4} (n))$ neurons and $T\approx n$ iterations, we bound the test loss by $\tilde{O}(1/ n)$. Our results differ from existing generalization outcomes using the algorithmic-stability framework, which necessitate polynomial width and yield suboptimal generalization rates. Central to our analysis is the use of a new self-bounded weak-convexity property, which leads to a generalized local quasi-convexity property for sufficiently parameterized neural-network classifiers. Eventually, despite the objective's non-convexity, this leads to convergence and generalization-gap bounds that resemble those found in the convex setting of linear logistic regression."

Most existing theoretical analyses of MALA rely on the smoothness and strong log-concavity properties of the target distribution, which are often lacking in practical Bayesian problems. Our analysis hinges on statistical large sample theory, which constrains the deviation of the Bayesian posterior from being smooth and log-concave in a very specific way. In particular, we introduce a new technique for bounding the mixing time of a Markov chain with a continuous state space via the $s$-conductance profile, offering improvements over existing techniques in several aspects. By employing this new technique, we establish the optimal parameter dimension dependence of $d^{1/3}$ and condition number dependence of $\kappa$ in the non-asymptotic mixing time upper bound for MALA after the burn-in period, under a standard Bayesian setting where the target posterior distribution is close to a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix having a condition number $\kappa$.

Our results are then used to prove that discrete graph Laplacians based on discrete, sample-driven Fermat distances converge to corresponding continuum operators.  In particular, we show the discrete eigenvalues and eigenvectors converge to their continuum analogues at a dimension-dependent rate, which allows us to interpret the efficacy of discrete spectral clustering using Fermat distances in terms of the resulting continuum limit.  The perspective afforded by our discrete-to-continuum Fermat distance analysis leads to new clustering algorithms for data and related insights into efficient computations associated to density-driven spectral clustering.  Our theoretical analysis is supported with numerical simulations and experiments on synthetic and real image data."

This results in deep learning model designers leveraging multi-objective optimization to design effective deep neural networks in multiple criteria. However, applying multi-objective optimizations to neural architecture search (NAS) is nontrivial because NAS tasks usually have a huge search space, along with a non-negligible searching cost. This requires effective multi-objective search algorithms to alleviate the GPU costs. In this work, we implement a novel multi-objectives optimizer based on a recently proposed meta-algorithm called LaMOO on NAS tasks. In a nutshell, LaMOO speedups the search process by learning a model from observed samples to partition the search space and then focusing on promising regions likely to contain a subset of the Pareto frontier. Using LaMOO, we observe an improvement of more than 200% sample efficiency compared to Bayesian optimization and evolutionary-based multi-objective optimizers on different NAS datasets. For example, when combined with LaMOO, qEHVI achieves a 225% improvement in sample efficiency compared to using qEHVI alone in NasBench201. For real-world tasks, LaMOO achieves 97.36% accuracy with only 1.62M #Params on CIFAR10 in only 600 search samples. On ImageNet, our large model reaches 80.4% top-1 accuracy with only 522M #FLOPs."

Under the smoothness condition on expected loss functions, it is shown that the expected static regret of optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) depends on the cumulative stochastic variance $\sigma_{1:T}^2$ and the cumulative adversarial variation $\Sigma_{1:T}^2$ for convex functions. Sachs et al. (2022) also provide a regret bound based on the maximal stochastic variance $\sigma_{\max}^2$ and the maximal adversarial variation $\Sigma_{\max}^2$ for strongly convex functions. Inspired by their work, we investigate the theoretical guarantees of optimistic online mirror descent (OMD) for the SEA model with smooth expected loss functions. For convex and smooth functions, we obtain the same $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sigma_{1:T}^2}+\sqrt{\Sigma_{1:T}^2})$ regret bound, but with a relaxation of the convexity requirement from individual functions to expected functions. For strongly convex and smooth functions, we establish an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\left(\sigma_{\max}^2+\Sigma_{\max}^2\right)\log \left(\left(\sigma_{1:T}^2 + \Sigma_{1:T}^2\right)/\left(\sigma_{\max}^2+\Sigma_{\max}^2\right)\right)\right)$ bound, better than their $\mathcal{O}((\sigma_{\max}^2$ $ + \Sigma_{\max}^2) \log T)$ result. For exp-concave and smooth functions, our approach yields a new $\mathcal{O}(d\log(\sigma_{1:T}^2+\Sigma_{1:T}^2))$ bound. Moreover, we introduce the first expected dynamic regret guarantee for the SEA model with convex and smooth expected functions, which is more favorable than static regret bounds in non-stationary environments. Furthermore, we expand our investigation to scenarios with non-smooth expected loss functions and propose novel algorithms built upon optimistic OMD with an implicit update, successfully attaining both static and dynamic regret guarantees."

Focusing on massively over-parameterized, fully connected residual networks with ReLU activation through their respective neural tangent kernels (ResNTK), we provide here a spectral analysis of these kernels. Specifically, we show that, much like NTK for fully connected networks (FC-NTK), for input distributed uniformly on the hypersphere $S^d$, the eigenvalues of ResNTK corresponding to their spherical harmonics eigenfunctions decay polynomially with frequency $k$ as $k^{-d}$. These in turn imply that the set of functions in their Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space are identical to those of both FC-NTK as well as the standard Laplace kernel. Our spectral analysis allows us to highlight several additional properties of ResNTK, which depend on the choice of a hyper-parameter that balances between the skip and residual connections. Specifically, (1) with no bias, deep ResNTK is significantly biased toward even frequency functions; (2) unlike FC-NTK for deep networks, which is spiky and therefore yields poor generalization, ResNTK is stable and yields small generalization errors.

Within each group, the observations associated to each of the arms follow the same distribution with the same mean vector. At each time step, the agent queries or pulls an arm and obtains an independent  observation from the distribution it is associated to. Subsequent pulls depend on previous ones as well as the previously obtained samples. The agent's task is to uncover the underlying partition of the arms with the least number of arm pulls and with a probability of error not exceeding a prescribed constant $\delta$.

In the supervised learning framework, accurate and efficient learning of dependencies between data instances and their corresponding labels requires auxiliary information about the data distribution and the target function. This central concept aligns with the notion of regularization in statistical learning theory. Real-world datasets are often characterized by multiscale data instance distributions and well-behaved, smooth target functions. Scale-invariant probability distributions, such as power-law distributions, provide notable examples of multiscale data instance distributions in various contexts. This paper introduces a hierarchical learning model that leverages such a multiscale data structure with a multiscale entropy-based training procedure and explores its statistical and computational advantages. The hierarchical learning model is inspired by the logical progression in human learning from easy to complex tasks and features interpretable levels. In this model, the logarithm of any data instance’s norm can be construed as the data instance's complexity, and the allocation of computational resources is tailored to this complexity, resulting in benefits such as increased inference speed. Furthermore, our multiscale analysis of the statistical risk yields stronger guarantees compared to conventional uniform convergence bounds."

To address this, we propose a Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) condition for linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models that incorporate latent variables, which establishes the independence between a linear combination of certain measured variables and some other measured variables. Specifically, for two observed random vectors $\bf{Y}$ and $\bf{Z}$, GIN holds if and only if $\omega^{\intercal}\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are statistically independent, where $\omega$ is a non-zero parameter vector determined by the cross-covariance between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$. We then give necessary and sufficient graphical criteria of the GIN condition in linear non-Gaussian acyclic causal models. From a graphical perspective, roughly speaking, GIN implies the existence of a set $\mathcal{S}$ such that $\mathcal{S}$ is causally earlier (w.r.t. the causal ordering) than $\mathbf{Y}$, and that every active (collider-free) path between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ must contain a node from $\mathcal{S}$. Interestingly, we find that the independent noise condition (i.e., if there is no confounder, causes are independent of the residual derived from regressing the effect on the causes) can be seen as a special case of GIN. With such a connection between GIN and latent causal structures,  we further leverage the proposed GIN condition, together with a well-designed search procedure, to efficiently estimate Linear, Non-Gaussian Latent Hierarchical Models (LiNGLaHs), where latent confounders may also be causally related and may even follow a hierarchical structure.  We show that the underlying causal structure of a LiNGLaH is identifiable in light of GIN conditions under mild assumptions.

However, there has been a dearth of comprehensive studies examining the impact of intrinsic structures; thus developers often feel challenging to apply a standardized configuration of SNNs across diverse datasets or tasks. This work delves deep into the intrinsic structures of SNNs. Initially, we draw two key conclusions: (1) the membrane time hyper-parameter is intimately linked to the eigenvalues of the integration operation, dictating the functional topology of spiking dynamics; (2) various hyper-parameters of the firing-reset mechanism govern the overall firing capacity of an SNN, mitigating the injection ratio or sampling density of input data. These findings elucidate why the efficacy of SNNs hinges heavily on the configuration of intrinsic structures and lead to a recommendation that enhancing the adaptability of these structures contributes to improving the overall performance and applicability of SNNs. Inspired by this recognition, we propose two feasible approaches to enhance SNN learning, involving developing self-connection architectures and stochastic spiking neurons to augment the adaptability of the integration operation and firing-reset mechanism, respectively. We theoretically prove that (1) both methods promote the expressive property for universal approximation, (2) the incorporation of self-connection architectures fosters ample solutions and structural stability for SNNs approximating adaptive dynamical systems, (3) the stochastic spiking neurons maintain generalization bounds with an exponential reduction in Rademacher complexity.

For two-layer neural networks, it has been understood via these asymptotics that the nature of the trained model radically changes depending on the scale of the initial random weights, ranging from a kernel regime (for large initial variance) to a feature learning regime (for small initial variance). For deeper networks more regimes are possible, and in this paper we study in detail a specific choice of ""small"" initialization corresponding to ""mean-field"" limits of neural networks, which we call integrable parameterizations (IPs).

We show that these notions arise naturally for univariate distributions through cumulative distribution function (CDF) transforms and compositions due to several ""group-like"" properties of univariate CDFs. While the traditional multivariate CDF does not preserve these properties, a new definition of multivariate CDF can restore these properties, thereby allowing the notions of ""addition"" and ""residualization"" to be formulated for multivariate settings as well.

We consider a distributionally robust formulation of offline RL, focusing on tabular robust Markov decision processes with an uncertainty set specified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence in both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings. To combat with sample scarcity, a model-based algorithm that combines distributionally robust value iteration with the principle of pessimism in the face of uncertainty is proposed, by penalizing the robust value estimates with a carefully designed data-driven penalty term. Under a mild and tailored assumption of the history dataset that measures distribution shift without requiring full coverage of the state-action space, we establish the finite-sample complexity of the proposed algorithms. We further develop an information-theoretic lower bound, which suggests that learning RMDPs is at least as hard as the standard MDPs when the uncertainty level is sufficient small, and corroborates the tightness of our upper bound up to polynomial factors of the (effective) horizon length for a range of uncertainty levels. To the best our knowledge, this provides the first provably near-optimal robust offline RL algorithm that learns under model uncertainty and partial coverage."

We propose a loss function for maximum likelihood estimation of the model weights and choose an architecture that provides us the analytical expression of the charts and of their inverses. Once the manifold is learned, we use it for solving inverse problems by minimizing a data fidelity term restricted to the learned manifold.

An ideal set of kernels should: admit a linear parameterization (for tractability); be dense in the set of all kernels (for robustness); be universal (for accuracy). Recently, a framework was proposed for using positive matrices to parameterize a class of positive semi-separable kernels. Although this class can be shown to meet all three criteria, previous algorithms for optimization of such kernels were limited to classification and furthermore relied on computationally complex Semidefinite Programming (SDP) algorithms. In this paper, we pose the problem of learning semiseparable kernels as a minimax optimization problem and propose a SVD-QCQP primal-dual algorithm which dramatically reduces the computational complexity as compared with previous SDP-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide an efficient implementation of this algorithm for both classification and regression -- an implementation which enables us to solve problems with 100 features and up to 30,000 datums. Finally, when applied to benchmark data, the algorithm demonstrates the potential for significant improvement in accuracy over typical (but non-convex) approaches such as Neural Nets and Random Forest with similar or better computation time."

In this paper, we leverage this flexibility and build on the time-parallel formulation of iterated extended Kalman smoothers to formulate a parallel-in-time probabilistic numerical ODE solver. Instead of simulating the dynamical system sequentially in time, as done by current probabilistic solvers, the proposed method processes all time steps in parallel and thereby reduces the computational complexity from linear to logarithmic in the number of time steps.

Can we find a suitable transformation of such data in a way that allows to discriminate between differences in this sense with statistical guarantees? In this paper, we consider the analysis and classification of complex point clouds as they are obtained, e.g., via single molecule localization microscopy. We focus on the task of identifying differences between noisy point clouds based on small scale characteristics, while disregarding large scale information such as overall size. We propose an approach based on a transformation of the data via the so-called Distance-to-Measure (DTM) function, a transformation which is based on the average of nearest neighbor distances. For each data set, we estimate the probability density of average local distances of all data points and use the estimated densities for classification. While the applicability is immediate and the practical performance of the proposed methodology is very good, the theoretical study of the density estimators is quite challenging, as they are based on non-i.i.d. observations that have been obtained via a complicated transformation. In fact, the transformed data are stochastically dependent in a non-local way that is not captured by commonly considered dependence measures. Nonetheless, we show that the asymptotic behaviour of the density estimator is driven by a kernel density estimator of certain i.i.d. random variables by using theoretical properties of $U$-statistics, which allows to handle the dependencies via a Hoeffding decomposition.  We show via a numerical study and in an application to simulated single molecule localization microscopy data of chromatin fibers that unsupervised classification tasks based on estimated DTM-densities achieve excellent separation results."

Integrating raw data, although powerful, is often not feasible, for example, when there are considerations on privacy protection. Distributed learning techniques have been developed to integrate summary statistics as opposed to raw data. In many existing distributed learning studies, it is stringently assumed that all the clients have the same model. To accommodate data heterogeneity, some federated learning methods allow for client-specific models. In this article, we consider the scenario that clients form clusters, those in the same cluster have the same model, and different clusters have different models. Further considering the clustering structure can lead to a better understanding of the “interconnections” among clients and reduce the number of parameters. To this end, we develop a novel penalization approach. Specifically, group penalization is imposed for regularized estimation and selection of important variables, and fusion penalization is imposed to automatically cluster clients. An effective ADMM algorithm is developed, and the estimation, selection, and clustering consistency properties are established under mild conditions. Simulation and data analysis further demonstrate the practical utility and superiority of the proposed approach."

Contrary to a common expectation that BO is suited to optimizing black-box functions, it actually requires domain knowledge about those functions to deploy BO successfully. Such domain knowledge often manifests in Gaussian process (GP) priors that specify initial beliefs on functions. However, even with expert knowledge, it is non-trivial to quantitatively define a prior. This is especially true for hyperparameter tuning problems on complex machine learning models, where landscapes of tuning objectives are often difficult to comprehend. We seek an alternative practice for setting these functional priors. In particular, we consider the scenario where we have data from similar functions that allow us to pre-train a tighter distribution a priori.  We detail what pre-training entails for GPs using a KL divergence based loss function, and propose a new pre-training based BO framework named HyperBO. Theoretically, we show bounded posterior predictions and near-zero regrets for HyperBO without assuming the ""ground truth"" GP prior is known. To verify our approach in realistic setups, we collect a large multi-task hyperparameter tuning dataset by training tens of thousands of configurations of near-state-of-the-art deep learning models on popular image and text datasets, as well as a protein sequence dataset.

Conceptually, our multi-trajectory setup sits between two traditional settings in statistical learning theory: learning from independent examples and learning from a single auto-correlated sequence.  Our conditions for efficient learning generalize the former setting---trajectories must be non-degenerate in ways that extend standard requirements for independent examples.  Notably, we do not require that trajectories be ergodic, long, nor strictly stable. For linear least-squares regression, given $n$-dimensional examples produced by $m$ trajectories, each of length $T$, we observe a notable change in statistical efficiency as the number of trajectories increases from a few (namely $m \lesssim n$) to many (namely $m \gtrsim n$).  Specifically, we establish that the worst-case error rate of this problem is $\Theta(n / m T)$ whenever $m \gtrsim n$.  Meanwhile, when $m \lesssim n$, we establish a (sharp) lower bound of $\Omega(n^2 / m^2 T)$ on the worst-case error rate, realized by a simple, marginally unstable linear dynamical system.  A key upshot is that, in domains where trajectories regularly reset, the error rate eventually behaves as if all of the examples were independent, drawn from their marginals.  As a corollary of our analysis, we also improve guarantees for the linear system identification problem."

The function, often referred to as the generator, is optimized to minimize a chosen distance measure between the generated and target distributions. One commonly used measure for this purpose is the Wasserstein distance. However, Wasserstein distance is hard to compute and optimize, and in practice entropic regularization techniques are used to facilitate its computation and improve numerical convergence. The influence of regularization on the learned solution, however, remains not well-understood. In this paper, we study how several popular entropic regularizations of Wasserstein distance impact the solution learned by a Wasserstein GAN in a simple benchmark setting where the generator is linear and the target distribution is high-dimensional Gaussian. We show that entropy regularization of Wasserstein distance promotes sparsification of the solution, while replacing the Wasserstein distance with the Sinkhorn divergence recovers the unregularized solution. The significant benefit of both regularization techniques is that they remove the curse of dimensionality suffered by Wasserstein distance. We show that in both cases the optimal generator can be learned to accuracy $\epsilon$ with $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ samples from the target distribution without requiring to constrain the discriminator. We thus conclude that these regularization techniques can improve the quality of the generator learned from empirical data in a way that is applicable for a large class of distributions."

Learning the model parameters in SSMs is arguably one of the most complicated tasks, and the inclusion of prior knowledge is known to both ease the interpretation but also to complicate the inferential tasks. Very recent works have attempted to incorporate a graphical perspective on some of those model parameters, but they present notable limitations that this work addresses. More generally, existing graphical modeling tools are designed to incorporate either static information, focusing on statistical dependencies among independent random variables (e.g., graphical Lasso approach), or dynamic information, emphasizing causal relationships among time series samples (e.g., graphical Granger approaches). However, there are no joint approaches combining static and dynamic graphical modeling within the context of SSMs. This work proposes a novel approach to fill this gap by introducing a joint graphical modeling framework that bridges the graphical Lasso model and a causal-based graphical approach for the linear-Gaussian SSM. We present DGLASSO (Dynamic Graphical Lasso), a new inference method within this framework that implements an efficient block alternating majorization-minimization algorithm. The algorithm's convergence is established by departing from modern tools from nonlinear analysis.

However, in a real social network, people frequently make decisions based on their local view of the network alone. Here, we consider a partial information framework that characterizes the local network centered at a given individual by path length $L$ and gives rise to a partial adjacency matrix. Under $L=2$, we focus on the problem of (global) community detection using the popular stochastic block model (SBM) and its degree-corrected variant (DCSBM). We derive theoretical properties of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from the signal term of the partial adjacency matrix and propose new spectral-based community detection algorithms that achieve consistency under appropriate conditions. Our analysis also allows us to propose a new centrality measure that assesses the importance of an individual's partial information in determining global community structure. Using simulated and real networks, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithms and compare our centrality measure with other popular alternatives to show it captures unique nodal information. Our results illustrate that the partial information framework enables us to compare the viewpoints of different individuals regarding the global structure."

These spaces emerge from studying the regularization effect of weight decay in training networks with activation functions like the rectified linear unit (ReLU). This framework offers a deeper understanding of multi-output networks and their function-space characteristics. A key contribution of this work is the development of a representer theorem for the vector-valued variation spaces. This representer theorem establishes that shallow vector-valued neural networks are the solutions to data-fitting problems over these infinite-dimensional spaces, where the network widths are bounded by the square of the number of training data. This observation reveals that the norm associated with these vector-valued variation spaces encourages the learning of features that are useful for multiple tasks, shedding new light on multi-task learning with neural networks. Finally, this paper develops a connection between weight-decay regularization and the multi-task lasso problem. This connection leads to novel bounds for layer widths in deep networks that depend on the intrinsic dimensions of the training data representations. This insight not only deepens the understanding of the deep network architectural requirements, but also yields a simple convex optimization method for deep neural network compression. The performance of this compression procedure is evaluated on various architectures."

This work establishes the first general nonparametric statistical convergence analysis for distribution learning via ODE models trained through likelihood maximization. We first prove a convergence theorem applicable to arbitrary velocity field classes $\mathcal{F}$ satisfying certain simple boundary constraints. This general result captures the trade-off between the approximation error and complexity of the ODE model. We show that the latter can be quantified via the $C^1$-metric entropy of the class $\mathcal{F}$. We then apply this general framework to the setting of $C^k$-smooth target densities, and establish nearly minimax-optimal convergence rates for two relevant velocity field classes $\mathcal{F}$: $C^k$ functions and neural networks. The latter is the practically important case of neural ODEs. Our results also provide insight on how the choice of velocity field class, and the dependence of this choice on sample size (e.g., the scaling of neural network classes), impact statistical performance."

In this paper we introduce invariant physics-informed neural networks for ordinary differential equations that admit a finite-dimensional group of Lie point symmetries. Using the method of equivariant moving frames, a differential equation is invariantized to obtain a, generally, simpler equation in the space of differential invariants. A solution to the invariantized equation is then mapped back to a solution of the original differential equation by solving the reconstruction equations for the left moving frame. The invariantized differential equation together with the reconstruction equations are solved using a physics-informed neural network, and form what we call an invariant physics-informed neural network. We illustrate the method with several examples, all of which considerably outperform standard non-invariant physics-informed neural networks."

We make several novel contributions for  improving the efficiency of random feature approximations for dot product kernels, to make these kernels more useful in large scale learning. First, we present a generalization of existing random feature approximations for polynomial kernels, such as Rademacher and Gaussian sketches and TensorSRHT, using complex-valued random features. We show empirically that the use of complex features can significantly reduce the variances of these approximations. Second, we provide a theoretical analysis for understanding the factors affecting the efficiency of various random feature approximations, by deriving closed-form expressions for their variances. These variance formulas elucidate conditions under which certain approximations (e.g., TensorSRHT) achieve lower variances than others (e.g., Rademacher sketches), and conditions under which the use of complex features leads to lower variances than real features.

Differently, for SGD with momentum, we demonstrate that the two hyperparameters together, the learning rate and the momentum coefficient, play a significant role in the linear convergence rate in non-convex optimizations. Our analysis is based on using a hyperparameters-dependent stochastic differential equation (hp-dependent SDE) that serves as a continuous surrogate for SGD with momentum. Similarly, we establish the linear convergence for the continuous-time formulation of SGD with momentum and obtain an explicit expression for the optimal linear rate by analyzing the spectrum of the Kramers-Fokker-Planck operator. By comparison, we demonstrate how the optimal linear rate of convergence and the final gap for SGD only about the learning rate varies with the momentum coefficient increasing from zero to one when the momentum is introduced.

This approach can be used to convert a wide variety of existing survival analysis models into ones that simultaneously encourage fairness, without requiring the user to specify which attributes or features to treat as sensitive in the training loss function. From a technical standpoint, our approach applies recent methodological developments of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to survival analysis. The complication is that existing DRO theory uses a training loss function that decomposes across contributions of individual data points, i.e., any term that shows up in the loss function depends only on a single training point. This decomposition does not hold for commonly used survival loss functions, including for the standard Cox proportional hazards model, its deep neural network variants, and many other recently developed survival analysis models that use loss functions involving ranking or similarity score calculations. We address this technical hurdle using a sample splitting strategy. We demonstrate our sample splitting DRO approach by using it to create fair versions of a diverse set of existing survival analysis models including the classical Cox model (and its deep neural network variant DeepSurv), the discrete-time model DeepHit, and the neural ODE model SODEN. We also establish a finite-sample theoretical guarantee to show what our sample splitting DRO loss converges to. Specifically for the Cox model, we further derive an exact DRO approach that does not use sample splitting.

In model-based RL, planning under a lower discount factor acts like a prior with stronger regularization on state-action pairs with more transition data. This leads to poor performance when the transition matrix is estimated from data sets with uneven amounts of data across state-action pairs.

Additionally, an easy-to-implement block coordinate ascent algorithm is developed with message-passing type updates in each block, whereas the complexity per iteration is linear with the number of nodes and time points. To certify the optimality, we demonstrate that the variational risk of the proposed variational inference approach attains the minimax optimal rate with only a logarithm factor under certain conditions. To this end,  we first derive the minimax lower bound, which might be of independent interest. In addition, we show that the posterior under commonly adopted Gaussian random walk priors can achieve the minimax lower bound with only a logarithm factor.

Specifically, we prove that, an $N$-agent constrained MARL problem, with state, and action spaces of each individual agents being of sizes $|\mathcal{X}|$, and $|\mathcal{U}|$ respectively, can be approximated by an associated constrained MFC problem with an error, $e\triangleq \mathcal{O}\left([\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}+\sqrt{|\mathcal{U}|}]/\sqrt{N}\right)$. In a special case where the reward, cost, and state transition functions are independent of the action distribution of the population, we prove that the error can be improved to $e=\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{|\mathcal{X}|}/\sqrt{N})$.

However, a formal theory that explains the role of causality in the generalization performance of UDA/SSL is still lacking. In this paper, we consider the UDA/SSL scenarios where we access $m$ labelled source data and $n$ unlabelled target data as training instances under different causal settings with a parametric probabilistic model. We study the learning performance (e.g., excess risk) of prediction in the target domain from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we distinguish two scenarios: the learning problem is called causal learning if the feature is the cause and the label is the effect, and is called anti-causal learning otherwise.  We show that in causal learning, the excess risk depends on the size of the source sample at a rate of $O(\frac{1}{m})$ only if the labelling distribution between the source and target domains remains unchanged. In anti-causal learning, we show that the unlabelled data dominate the performance at a rate of typically $O(\frac{1}{n})$. These results bring out the relationship between the data sample size and the hardness of the learning problem with different causal mechanisms."

However,  batch active learning typically pays the price of a reduced adaptivity, leading to suboptimal results. In this paper we propose a solution which requires a careful trade off between the informativeness of the queried points and their diversity. We theoretically investigate batch active learning in the practically relevant scenario where the unlabeled pool of data is available beforehand (pool-based active learning). We analyze a novel stage-wise greedy algorithm and show that, as a function of the label complexity, the excess risk of this algorithm matches the known minimax rates in a standard statistical learning setting with linear function spaces. Our results also exhibit a mild dependence on the batch size. These initial results are then extended to hold for general function spaces with similar algorithmics.

Motivated by penalty methods from continuous optimization, we propose and study penalized Langevin Dynamics (PLD) and penalized underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo (PULMC) methods for constrained sampling that convert the constrained sampling problem into an unconstrained sampling problem by introducing a penalty function for constraint violations. When $f$ is smooth and gradients of $f$ are available, we show ${\tilde{O}}(d/\varepsilon^{10})$ iteration complexity for PLD to sample the target up to an $\varepsilon$-error where the error is measured in terms of the total variation distance and $\tilde{O}(\cdot)$ hides some logarithmic factors. For PULMC, we improve this result to $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon^{7})$ when the Hessian of $f$ is Lipschitz and the boundary of $C$ is sufficiently smooth. To our knowledge, these are the first convergence rate results for underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo methods in the constrained sampling setting that can handle non-convex choices of $f$ and can provide guarantees with the best dimension dependency among existing methods for constrained sampling when the gradients are deterministically available. We then consider the setting where only unbiased stochastic estimates of the gradients of $f$ are available, motivated by applications to large-scale Bayesian learning problems. We propose PSGLD and PSGULMC methods that are variants of PLD and PULMC that can handle stochastic gradients and that are scaleable to large datasets without requiring Metropolis-Hasting correction steps.

However, in many of the above applications one is interested in the pointwise evaluation of the Radon-Nikodym derivatives rather than in their approximation as elements of some spaces of functions, and this aspect has been left unexplored in the previous studies. To address the above problem, we employ the general regularization scheme in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The convergence rate of the corresponding regularized algorithm is established by taking into account both the smoothness of the derivative and the capacity of the space in which it is estimated. This is done in terms of general source conditions and the regularized Christoffel functions.

Our convergence rates improve significantly over the ones of $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{5/7}})$ and $O((\frac{L}{\mu})^{5/7}\frac{1}{(1-\sigma)^{1.5}}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon})$, respectively, which were proved in the original literature of accelerated gradient tracking only for static graphs, where $\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}}$ equals $\frac{1}{1-\sigma}$ when the network is time-invariant. When combining with a multiple consensus subroutine, the dependence on the network connectivity constants can be further improved to $O(1)$ and $O(\frac{\gamma}{1-\sigma_{\gamma}})$ for the gradient oracle and communication round complexities, respectively. When the network is static, by employing the Chebyshev acceleration, our complexities exactly match the lower bounds without hiding any poly-logarithmic factor for both nonstrongly convex and strongly convex problems."

For numerous machine learning applications, data can be naturally viewed as samples drawn from spaces of functions, such as curves and surfaces, in high dimensions. Optimal transport for functional data analysis provides a useful framework of treatment for such domains. Since probability measures in infinite dimensional spaces generally lack absolute continuity (i.e., with respect to non-degenerate Gaussian measures), the Monge map in the standard optimal transport theory for finite dimensional spaces typically does not exist in the functional settings arising in such machine learning applications. This necessitates a suitable notion of approximation for the best pushforward measure to be obtained via a transport map. Indeed, our approach to the transportation problem in functional spaces is by a suitable regularization technique --- we restrict the class of transport maps to be a Hilbert-Schmidt space of operators.Within this regularization framework, we develop an efficient algorithm for finding the stochastic transport map between functional domains and provide theoretical guarantees on the existence, uniqueness, and consistency of our estimate for the Hilbert-Schmidt space of compact linear operators.

Valid inference can then be obtained so long as both predictions converge (sufficiently fast) to the truth.

Despite its success in various applications, there has been a lack of systematic study on the regularization ability of random smoothing. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by presenting a framework for random smoothing regularization that can adaptively and effectively learn a wide range of ground truth functions belonging to the classical Sobolev spaces. Specifically, we investigate two underlying function spaces: the Sobolev space of low intrinsic dimension, which includes the Sobolev space in D-dimensional Euclidean space or low-dimensional sub-manifolds as special cases, and the mixed smooth Sobolev space with a tensor structure. By using random smoothing regularization as novel convolution-based smoothing kernels, we can attain optimal convergence rates in these cases using a kernel gradient descent algorithm, either with early stopping or weight decay. It is noteworthy that our estimator can adapt to the structural assumptions of the underlying data and avoid the curse of dimensionality. This is achieved through various choices of injected noise distributions such as Gaussian, Laplace, or general polynomial noises, allowing for broad adaptation to the aforementioned structural assumptions of the underlying data. The convergence rate depends only on the effective dimension, which may be significantly smaller than the actual data dimension.

We underline differences in terms of convergence rates between several unbiased compression operators, that all satisfy the same condition on their variance, thus going beyond the classical worst-case analysis. To do so, we focus on the case of least-squares regression (LSR) and analyze a general stochastic approximation algorithm for minimizing quadratic functions relying on a random field. We consider weak assumptions on the random field, tailored to the analysis (specifically, expected Hölder regularity), and on the noise covariance, enabling the analysis of various randomizing mechanisms, including compression. We then extend our results to the case of federated learning. More formally, we highlight the impact on the convergence of the covariance $\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}}$ of the additive noise induced by the algorithm. We demonstrate despite the non-regularity of the stochastic field, that the limit variance term scales with $\mathrm{Tr}(\mathfrak{C}_{\mathrm{ania}} H^{-1})/K$ (where $H$ is the Hessian of the optimization problem and $K$ the number of iterations) generalizing the rate for the vanilla LSR case where it is $\sigma^2 \mathrm{Tr}(H H^{-1}) / K = \sigma^2 d / K$ (Bach and Moulines, 2013).

Inspired by this, we look at the relationship between information loss in the Shannon sense and the operation loss in the minimum probability of error (MPE) sense when considering a family of lossy representations. Our first result offers a lower bound on a weak form of information loss as a function of its respective operation loss when adopting a discrete encoder. When considering a general family of lossy continuous representations, we show that a form of vanishing information loss (a weak informational sufficiency (WIS)) implies a vanishing MPE loss. Our findings support the observation that selecting/designing representations that capture informational sufficiency is appropriate for learning. However, this selection is rather conservative if the intended goal is achieving MPE in classification. Supporting this, we show that it is possible to adopt an alternative notion of informational sufficiency (strictly weaker than pure sufficiency in the mutual information sense) to achieve operational sufficiency in learning. Furthermore, our new WIS condition is used to demonstrate the expressive power of digital encoders and the capacity of two existing compression-based algorithms to achieve lossless prediction in ML."

This paradigm is suitable for applications such as severe disease diagnosis, fraud detection, among others. A series of NP classifiers have been developed to guarantee the type I error control with high probability.  However, these existing classifiers involve a sample splitting step: a mixture of class 0 and class 1 observations to construct a scoring function and some left-out class 0 observations to construct a threshold. This splitting enables classifier threshold construction built upon independence, but it amounts to insufficient use of data for training and a potentially higher type II error.  Leveraging a canonical linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model, we derive a quantitative CLT for a certain functional of quadratic forms of the inverse of sample and population covariance matrices,  and based on this result,  develop for the first time NP classifiers without splitting the training sample.

The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve strong performance across different settings: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2.

Then we adapt the Follow the Perturbed Leader (FTPL) framework, and propose learning policies with both Gaussian and Beta perturbed distributions (DP-FTPL-Gauss and DP-FTPL-Beta) to protect $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. The analysis shows that they achieve an $O({N\log T\over \Delta_{\min}} + N \min\{{1\over \delta^2}, {1\over \epsilon^2}\log{1\over \delta}\})$ regret upper bound, where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the minimum expected reward gap between the optimal arm and any other ones. We also design a unique perturbed distribution to protect $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy in the FTPL framework (DP-FTPL-New), which reduces the regret upper bound to $O({N\log T\over \Delta_{\min}} + {N\over \epsilon }\log {(e^{\epsilon} -1)T + \delta T \over (e^{\epsilon}-1) + \delta T})$. We further show that this perturbed distribution could also be used to protect $(\epsilon,\delta)$-global differential privacy, and design a corresponding algorithm GDP-Elim-New. We show that its regret upper bound is  $O({\Delta_{\max} \over \Delta_{\min}}({N\log T\over \Delta_{\min}} + {N\over \epsilon }\log {(e^{\epsilon} -1)T + \delta T \over (e^{\epsilon}-1) + \delta T}))$. This shows that our $\Omega({N\over \epsilon }\log {(e^{\epsilon} -1)T + \delta T \over (e^{\epsilon}-1) + \delta T})$ regret lower bound is tight (e.g. when ${\Delta_{\max}\over \Delta_{\min}}$ is bounded)."

For example, universities ask students to rate the teaching quality of their instructors, and conference organizers ask authors of submissions to evaluate the quality of the reviews. However, in these applications, students often give a higher rating to a course if they receive higher grades in a course, and authors often give a higher rating to the reviews if their papers are accepted to the conference. In this work, we call these external factors the ""outcome"" experienced by people, and consider the problem of mitigating these outcome-induced biases in the given ratings when some information about the outcome is available. We formulate the information about the outcome as a known partial ordering on the bias. We propose a debiasing method by solving a regularized optimization problem under this ordering constraint, and also provide a carefully designed cross-validation method that adaptively chooses the appropriate amount of regularization. We provide theoretical guarantees on the performance of our algorithm, as well as experimental evaluations."

Thus, learning kernels in operators from data is an inverse problem of general interest. Due to the nonlocal dependence, the inverse prob- lem is often severely ill-posed with a data-dependent normal operator. Traditional Bayesian methods address the ill-posedness by a non-degenerate prior, which may result in an unsta- ble posterior mean in the small noise regime, especially when data induces a perturbation in the null space of the normal operator. We propose a new data-adaptive Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) prior, which ensures the stability of the posterior mean in the small noise regime. We analyze this adaptive prior and showcase its efficacy through applications on Toeplitz matrices and integral operators. Numerical experiments reveal that fixed non-degenerate priors can produce divergent posterior means under errors from discretization, model inaccuracies, partial observations, or erroneous noise assumptions. In contrast, our data-adaptive RKHS prior consistently yields convergent posterior means."

It is now common to benchmark agents with millions of parameters against dozens of tasks, each using the equivalent of 30 days of experience. The scale of these experiments often conflict with the need for statistical evidence, especially when comparing algorithms. Recent studies have highlighted how popular algorithms are sensitive to hyperparameter settings and implementation details, and that common empirical practice leads to weak statistical evidence (Machado et al., 2018; Henderson et al., 2018).  This manuscript represents both a call to action, and a comprehensive resource for how to do good experiments in reinforcement learning. In particular, we cover: the statistical assumptions underlying common performance measures, how to properly characterize performance variation and stability, hypothesis testing, special considerations for comparing multiple agents, baseline and illustrative example construction, and how to deal with hyperparameters and experimenter bias. Throughout we highlight common mistakes found in the literature and the statistical consequences of those in example experiments.

Our contribution involves proposing accelerated iteratively reweighted nuclear norm methods designed to solve the nonconvex low-rank minimization problem. Two major novelties characterize our approach. First, the proposed method possesses an active manifold identification property, enabling the provable identification of the correct rank of the stationary point within a finite number of iterations. Second, we introduce an adaptive updating strategy for smoothing parameters. This strategy automatically fixes parameters associated with zero singular values as constants upon detecting the correct rank while quickly driving the remaining parameters to zero. This adaptive behavior transforms the algorithm into one that effectively solves smooth problems after a few iterations, setting our work apart from existing iteratively reweighted methods for low-rank optimization.  We prove the global convergence of the proposed algorithm, guaranteeing that every limit point of the iterates is a critical point. Furthermore, a local convergence rate analysis is provided under the Kurdyka-Łojasiewicz property. We conduct numerical experiments using both synthetic and real data to showcase our algorithm's efficiency and superiority over existing methods."

However, the predictive performance of different trees within the forest can vary significantly due to the randomization of the embedded bootstrap sampling and feature selection. In this paper, we focus on RF for regression and propose two optimal weighting algorithms, namely the 1 Step Optimal Weighted RF (1step-WRF$_\mathrm{opt}$) and 2 Steps Optimal Weighted RF (2steps-WRF$_\mathrm{opt}$), that combine the base learners through the weights determined by weight choice criteria. Under some regularity conditions, we show that these algorithms are asymptotically optimal in the sense that the resulting squared loss and risk are asymptotically identical to those of the infeasible but best possible weighted RF.

We prove that under such initialization, the neural network will have sparse activation throughout the entire training process, which enables fast training procedures via some sophisticated computational methods. With such initialization, we show that the neural networks possess a different limiting kernel which we call bias-generalized NTK, and we study various properties of the neural networks with this new kernel.

In particular, we show that the network in this case can achieve as fast convergence as the dense network, as opposed to the previous work suggesting that the sparse networks converge slower.  In addition, our result improves the previous required width to ensure convergence. Secondly, we study the networks' generalization: we show a width-sparsity dependence, which yields a sparsity-dependent Rademacher complexity and generalization bound.  To our knowledge, this is the first sparsity-dependent generalization result via Rademacher complexity.  Lastly, we study the smallest eigenvalue of this new kernel. We identify a data-dependent region where we can derive a much sharper lower bound on the NTK's smallest eigenvalue than the worst-case bound previously known.

The aim of this paper is to introduce stability from statistical learning theory into model averaging. Thus, we define the stability, asymptotic empirical risk minimization, generalization and consistency of model averaging, and study the relationship among them. Similar to the existing results in literature, we find that stability can ensure that the model averaging estimator has good generalization performance and consistency under reasonable conditions, where consistency means that the model averaging estimator can asymptotically minimize the mean squared prediction error. We also propose an $L_2$-penalty model averaging method without limiting model weights, and prove that it has stability and consistency. In order to overcome selection uncertainty of the $L_2$-penalty parameter, we use cross-validation to select a candidate set of $L_2$-penalty parameters, and then perform a weighted average of the estimators of model weights based on cross-validation errors. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method with a Monte Carlo simulation and application to a prediction task on the wage1 dataset."

"231213","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-1213/23-1213.pdf","","Student learners typically engage in an iterative process of actively updating its hypotheses, like active learning. While this behavior can be advantageous, there is an inherent risk of introducing mistakes through incremental updates including weak initialization, inaccurate or insignificant history states, resulting in expensive convergence cost. In this work, rather than solely monitoring the update of the learner's status, we propose monitoring the disagreement w.r.t. $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{T}(\cdot)$ between the learner and teacher, and call this new paradigm “Mentored Learning”, which consists of `how to teach' and `how to learn'. By actively incorporating feedback that deviates from the learner's current hypotheses,  convergence will be much easier to analyze without strict assumptions on learner's historical status, then deriving tighter generalization bounds on error and label complexity. Formally, we introduce an approximately optimal teaching hypothesis, $h^\mathcal{T}$,    incorporating a tighter slack term $\left(1+\mathcal{F}^{\mathcal{T}}(\widehat{h}_t)\right)\Delta_t$ to replace the typical $2\Delta_t$ used in hypothesis pruning.  Theoretically, we demonstrate that, guided by this teaching hypothesis, the learner can converge to  tighter generalization bounds on error and label complexity compared to non-educated learners who lack guidance from a teacher: 1)   the generalization error upper bound can be reduced from $R(h^*)+4\Delta_{T-1}$ to approximately $R(h^{\mathcal{T}})+2\Delta_{T-1}$, and 2)  the label complexity upper bound can be decreased from $4 \theta\left(TR(h^{*})+2O(\sqrt{T})\right)$ to approximately $2\theta\left(2TR(h^{\mathcal{T}})+3 O(\sqrt{T})\right)$. To adhere strictly to our assumption, self-improvement of teaching is proposed when $h^\mathcal{T}$ loosely approximates $h^*$. In the context of learning, we further consider two teaching scenarios: instructing a white-box and black-box learner. Experiments validate this teaching concept and demonstrate superior generalization performance compared to fundamental active learning strategies, such as IWAL, IWAL-D, etc."

We show that one does not need to access this decomposition to learn in RKKS. We then investigate the conditions under which a kernel is positively decomposable. We show that invariant kernels admit a positive decomposition on homogeneous spaces under tractable regularity assumptions. This makes them much easier to construct than positive definite kernels, providing a route for learning with kernels for non-Euclidean data.

Background planning with learned models is often worse than model-free alternatives, such as Double DQN, even though the former uses significantly more memory and computation. The fundamental problem is that learned models can be inaccurate and often generate invalid states, especially when iterated many steps. In this paper, we avoid this limitation by constraining background planning to a given set of (abstract) subgoals and learning only local, subgoal-conditioned models. This goal-space planning (GSP) approach is more computationally efficient, naturally incorporates temporal abstraction for faster long-horizon planning, and avoids learning the transition dynamics entirely.

In particular, we show that one can lower bound the risk with any information measure by upper bounding its dual via Markov's inequality. We are thus able to provide estimator-independent impossibility results thanks to the Data-Processing Inequalities that divergences satisfy. The results are then applied to settings of interest involving both discrete and continuous parameters, including the “Hide-and-Seek” problem, and compared to the state-of-the-art techniques. An important observation is that the behaviour of the lower bound in the number of samples is influenced by the choice of the information measure. We leverage this by introducing a new divergence inspired by the “Hockey-Stick” divergence, which is demonstrated empirically to provide the largest lower bound across all considered settings.

Consequently, we establish that it attains a minimax sample complexity upper bound of $\tilde O(|\mathbf{S}||\mathbf{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\epsilon^{-2})$, where $\mathbf{S}$ and $\mathbf{A}$ denote the state and action spaces.  This is the first complexity result that is independent of the ambiguity size $\delta$, thereby providing new complexity theoretic insights.

A general family of non-linear factor models is considered, under which the matrix completion problem becomes the estimation of  an $n$ by $p$ low-rank matrix ${\mathbf M}$. For existing methods in the literature, estimation consistency is established by showing $\Vert \hat {\mathbf M} - {\mathbf M}^*\Vert_F/\sqrt{np}$, the scaled Frobenius norm of the difference between the estimated and true ${\mathbf M}$ matrices, converges to zero in probability as $n$ and $p$ grow to infinity. However, this notion of consistency does not guarantee the convergence of each individual entry and, thus, may not be sufficient when specific data entries or the worst-case scenario is of interest. To address this issue, we consider the notion of entrywise consistency based on $\Vert \hat {\mathbf M} - {\mathbf M}^* \Vert_{\mbox{max}}$, the max norm of the estimation error matrix. We propose refinement procedures that turn estimators, which are consistent in the Frobenius norm sense, into entrywise estimators through a one-step refinement. Tight probabilistic error bounds are derived for the proposed estimators. The proposed methods are evaluated by simulation studies and real-data applications for collaborative filtering and large-scale educational assessment."

In this work, we derive novel statistical bounds for empirical plug-in estimators of the EOT cost and show that their statistical performance in the entropy regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ and the sample size $n$ only depends on the simpler of the two probability measures. For instance, under sufficiently smooth costs this yields the parametric rate $n^{-1/2}$ with factor $\varepsilon^{-d/2}$, where $d$ is the minimum dimension of the two population measures. This confirms that empirical EOT also adheres to the lower complexity adaptation principle, a hallmark feature only recently identified for unregularized OT. As a consequence of our theory, we show that the empirical entropic Gromov-Wasserstein distance and its unregularized version for measures on Euclidean spaces also obey this principle. Additionally, we comment on computational aspects and complement our findings with Monte Carlo simulations. Our technique employs empirical process theory and relies on a dual formulation of EOT over a single function class. Central to our analysis is the observation that the entropic cost-transformation of a function class does not increase its uniform metric entropy by much."

This paper introduces PROMISE (Preconditioned Stochastic Optimization Methods by Incorporating Scalable Curvature Estimates), a suite of sketching-based preconditioned stochastic gradient algorithms that deliver fast convergence on ill-conditioned large-scale convex optimization problems arising in machine learning. PROMISE includes preconditioned versions of SVRG, SAGA, and Katyusha; each algorithm comes with a strong theoretical analysis and effective default hyperparameter values.

On the theoretical side, this paper introduces the notion of quadratic regularity in order to establish linear convergence of all proposed methods even when the preconditioner is updated infrequently. The speed of linear convergence is determined by the quadratic regularity ratio, which often provides a tighter bound on the convergence rate compared to the condition number, both in theory and in practice, and explains the fast global linear convergence of the proposed methods."

For real-world data, however, one intuitively expects the presence of a benign structure so that interpolation already occurs at a smaller network size than suggested by memorization capacity. In this paper, we investigate interpolation by adopting an instance-specific viewpoint. We introduce a simple randomized algorithm that, given a fixed finite data set with two classes, with high probability constructs an interpolating three-layer neural network in polynomial time. The required number of parameters is linked to geometric properties of the two classes and their mutual arrangement. As a result, we obtain guarantees that are independent of the number of samples and hence move beyond worst-case memorization capacity bounds.

First, we compare the influence of batch size to that of multiple (but finitely many) steps. For a single gradient step, a batch of size $n = O(d)$ is both necessary and sufficient to align with the target function, although only a single direction can be learned. In contrast, $n = O(d^2)$ is essential for neurons to specialize in multiple relevant directions of the target with a single gradient step. Even in this case, we show there might exist “hard” directions requiring $n = O(d^\ell)$ samples to be learned, where $\ell$ is known as the leap index of the target. Second, we show that the picture drastically improves over multiple gradient steps: a batch size of $n = O(d)$ is indeed sufficient to learn multiple target directions satisfying a staircase property, where more and more directions can be learned over time. Finally, we discuss how these directions allow for a drastic improvement in the approximation capacity and generalization error over the initialization, illustrating a separation of scale between the random features/lazy regime and the feature learning regime. Our technical analysis leverages a combination of techniques related to concentration, projection-based conditioning, and Gaussian equivalence, which we believe are of independent interest. By pinning down the conditions necessary for specialization and learning, our results highlight the intertwined role of the structure of the task to learn, the detail of the algorithm (the batch size), and the architecture (i.e., the number of hidden neurons), shedding new light on how neural networks adapt to the feature and learn complex task from data over time."

Here, we provide a deep extension of such random feature models, which we call the rainbow model. We prove that rainbow networks define deterministic (hierarchical) kernels in the infinite-width limit. The resulting functions thus belong to a data-dependent RKHS which does not depend on the weight randomness. We also verify numerically our modeling assumptions on deep CNNs trained on image classification tasks, and show that the trained networks approximately satisfy the rainbow hypothesis. In particular, rainbow networks sampled from the corresponding random feature model achieve similar performance as the trained networks.

We show, in analogy with AD, that federated AD may be implemented using various accumulation modes, which introduce distinct computation-communication trade-offs and systems requirements. Further, we show that a broad class of federated computations is closed under these modes of federated AD, implying that if the original computation can be implemented using privacy-preserving primitives, its derivative may be computed using the same primitives. We then show how federated AD can be used to create algorithms that dynamically learn components of the algorithm itself.

In this work, we first theoretically analyze gradual self-training, a popular GDA algorithm, and provide a significantly improved generalization bound compared with Kumar et al. (2020). Our theoretical analysis leads to an interesting insight: to minimize the generalization error on the target domain, the sequence of intermediate domains should be placed uniformly along the Wasserstein geodesic between the source and target domains. The insight is particularly useful under the situation where intermediate domains are missing or scarce, which is often the case in real-world applications. Based on the insight, we propose Generative Gradual Domain Adaptation with Optimal Transport (GOAT), an algorithmic framework that can generate intermediate domains in a data-dependent way.

We consider two kinds of zero-order projected gradient descent algorithms, which differ in the form of the gradient estimator. The first algorithm uses a gradient estimator based on randomization over the $\ell_2$ sphere due to Bach and Perchet (2016).  We present an improved analysis of this algorithm on the class of highly smooth and strongly convex functions studied in the prior work, and we derive rates of convergence for two more general classes of non-convex functions. Namely, we consider highly smooth functions satisfying the Polyak-Łojasiewicz condition and the class of highly smooth functions with no additional property. The second algorithm is based on randomization over the $\ell_1$ sphere, and it extends to the highly smooth setting the algorithm that was recently proposed for Lipschitz convex functions in Akhavan et al. (2022). We show that, in the case of noiseless oracle, this novel algorithm enjoys better bounds on bias and variance than the $\ell_2$ randomization and the commonly used Gaussian randomization algorithms, while in the noisy case both $\ell_1$  and $\ell_2$  algorithms benefit from similar improved theoretical guarantees. The improvements are achieved thanks to a new proof techniques based on Poincaré type inequalities for uniform distributions on the $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ spheres. The results are established under weak (almost adversarial) assumptions on the noise. Moreover, we provide minimax lower bounds proving optimality or near optimality of the obtained upper bounds in several cases."

In this work, we study a fundamental variant of the ODT problem in which some test outcomes are noisy, even in the more general case where the noise is persistent, i.e., repeating a test gives the same noisy output. Our approximation algorithms provide guarantees that are nearly best possible and hold for the general case of a large number of noisy outcomes per test or per hypothesis where the performance degrades continuously with this number.

Due to its compact representation, TT decomposition has been widely used in the fields of signal processing, machine learning, and quantum physics. It offers benefits such as reduced memory requirements, enhanced computational efficiency, and decreased sampling complexity. Nevertheless, existing optimization algorithms with  guaranteed performance concentrate exclusively on using the TT format for reducing the optimization space in recovery problems, while still operating on the entire tensor in each iteration. There is a lack of comprehensive theoretical analysis for optimization involving the factors directly, despite the proven efficacy of such factorization methods in practice. In this paper, we provide the first convergence guarantee for the factorization approach in a TT-based recovery problem. Specifically, to avoid the scaling ambiguity and to facilitate theoretical analysis, we optimize over the so-called left-orthogonal TT format which enforces orthonormality among most of the factors. To ensure the orthonormal structure, we utilize the Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) for optimizing those factors over the Stiefel manifold. We first delve into the TT factorization/decomposition problem and establish the local linear convergence of RGD. Notably, the rate of convergence only experiences a linear decline as the tensor order increases. We then study the sensing problem that aims to recover a TT format tensor from linear measurements. Assuming the sensing operator satisfies the restricted isometry property (RIP), we show that with a proper initialization, which could be obtained through spectral initialization, RGD also converges to the ground-truth tensor at a linear rate. Furthermore, we expand our analysis to encompass scenarios involving Gaussian noise in the measurements. We prove that RGD can reliably recover the ground truth at a linear rate, with the recovery error exhibiting only polynomial growth in relation to the tensor order $N$.

Recent years have witnessed several examples of problems where optimal statistical performance is only achievable via non-convex and improper estimators originating from aggregation theory, including the fundamental problem of model selection. These examples are currently outside the reach of the classical local Rademacher complexity theory. In this work, we build upon the recent approach to localization via offset Rademacher complexities, for which a general high-probability theory has yet to be established. Our main result is an exponential-tail offset Rademacher complexity excess risk upper bound that yields results at least as sharp as those obtainable via the classical theory. However, our bound applies under an estimator-dependent geometric condition (the “offset condition”) instead of the estimator-independent (but, in general, distribution-dependent) Bernstein condition on which the classical theory relies.

We show that the regret of our proposed method is upper bounded by $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ and further devise a lower bound to show that our algorithm is efficient, incurring the same $\Omega(T^{2 / 3})$ regret as the lower bound, where $T$ is the total number of rounds. Our work establishes the regret guarantee for online RL in solving dynamic mechanism design problems without prior knowledge of the underlying model."
"230552","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-0552/23-0552.pdf","","This paper analyzes the statistical performance of a robust spectral clustering method for latent structure recovery in noisy data matrices. We consider eigenvector-based clustering applied to a matrix of nonparametric rank statistics that is derived entrywise from the raw, original data matrix. This approach is robust in the sense that, unlike traditional spectral clustering procedures, it can provably recover population-level latent block structure even when the observed data matrix includes heavy-tailed entries and has a heterogeneous variance profile. Here, the raw input data may be viewed as a weighted adjacency matrix whose entries constitute links that connect nodes in an underlying graph or network. Our main theoretical contributions are threefold and hold under flexible data generating conditions. First, we establish that robust spectral clustering with rank statistics can consistently recover latent block structure, viewed as communities of nodes in a graph, in the sense that unobserved community memberships for all but a vanishing fraction of nodes are correctly recovered with high probability when the data matrix is large. Second, we refine the former result and further establish that, under certain conditions, the community membership of any individual, specified node of interest can be asymptotically exactly recovered with probability tending to one in the large-data limit. Third, we establish asymptotic normality results associated with the truncated eigenstructure of matrices whose entries are rank statistics, made possible by synthesizing contemporary entrywise matrix perturbation analysis with the classical nonparametric theory of so-called simple linear rank statistics. Collectively, these results demonstrate the statistical utility of rank-based data transformations when paired with spectral techniques for dimensionality reduction. Numerical examples illustrate and support our theoretical findings. Additionally, for a data set consisting of human connectomes, our approach yields parsimonious dimensionality reduction and improved recovery of ground-truth neuroanatomical cluster structure. We conclude with a discussion of extensions, practical considerations, and future work."

Solving MFGs provides approximate Nash equilibria for stochastic, differential games with finite but large populations of agents. The master equation is a partial differential equation (PDE) whose solution characterizes MFG equilibria for any possible initial distribution. The first method we propose relies on backward induction in a time component while the second method directly tackles the PDE without discretizing time. For both approaches, we prove two types of results: there exist neural networks that make the algorithms' loss functions arbitrarily small and conversely, if the losses are small, then the neural networks are good approximations of the master equation's solution. We conclude the paper with numerical experiments on benchmark problems from the literature up to dimension 15, and a comparison with solutions computed by a classical method for fixed initial distributions."

Our study identifies that the root of this counter-intuitive behavior lies in the use of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architectures with non-suitable initialization schemes, which result in poor trainablity for the network derivatives, and ultimately lead to an unstable minimization of the PDE residual loss. To address this, we introduce Physics-Informed Residual Adaptive Networks (PirateNets), a novel architecture that is designed to facilitate stable and efficient training of deep PINN models. PirateNets leverage a novel adaptive residual connection, which allows the networks to be initialized as shallow networks that progressively deepen during training. We also show that the proposed initialization scheme allows us to encode appropriate inductive biases corresponding to a given PDE system into the network architecture. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that PirateNets are easier to optimize and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth, ultimately achieving state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks.

Restricted inference, for example, restricted likelihood ratio testing, attempts to exploit the structure of a statistical submodel that is a subset of the specified family.  We consider the problem of testing a simple hypothesis against alternatives from such a submodel.  In the case of an unknown submodel, it is not clear how to realize the benefits of restricted inference.  To do so, we first construct information tests that are locally asymptotically equivalent to likelihood ratio tests.  Information tests are conceptually appealing but (in general) computationally intractable.  However, unlike restricted likelihood ratio tests, restricted information tests can be approximated even when the statistical submodel is unknown.  We construct approximate information tests using manifold learning procedures to extract information from samples of an unknown (or intractable) submodel, thereby providing a roadmap for computational solutions to a class of previously impenetrable problems in statistical inference.  Examples illustrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology."

It was also shown that, as a consequence of the diffusion limit, the MALA algorithm is optimized at an average acceptance probability of $0.574$. Pereyra introduced the proximal MALA algorithm where the gradient of the log target density is replaced by the proximal function (mainly aimed at implementing MALA for non-differentiable target densities). In this paper, we show that for a wide class of twice differentiable target densities, the proximal MALA enjoys the same optimal scaling as that of MALA in high dimensions and also has an average optimal acceptance probability of $0.574$. The results of this paper thus give the following practically useful guideline: for smooth target densities where it is expensive to compute the gradient while implementing MALA, users may replace the gradient with the corresponding proximal function (that can be often computed relatively cheaply via convex optimization) without losing any efficiency gains from optimal scaling. We show this for two class of examples. First, for the product of Gaussians, we identify the optimal scale for proximal MALA and show that it is identical to MALA. Next, following the exact framework used in the author's previous paper, we define a version of the proximal MALA algorithm in a Hilbert space. We show that for a certain class of twice differentiable, infinite dimensional non-product measures commonly used in applications, the proximal MALA applied to an $N-$dimensional approximation of the target also will take ${\cal O}(N^{\frac13})$ steps to explore the invariant measure, with an optimal acceptance probability of $0.574$.

Next, we propose the concept of transductive supersample and use it to derive transductive information-theoretic bounds involving conditional mutual information and different information measures.

"231422","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/23-1422/23-1422.pdf","","Recent advances in dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) facilitate the search for optimal treatments, which are tailored to individuals' specific needs and able to maximize their expected clinical benefits. However, existing algorithms relying on consistent trajectories, such as inverse probability weighting estimators (IPWEs), could suffer from insufficient sample size under optimal treatments and a growing number of decision-making stages, particularly in the context of chronic diseases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel individualized learning method which estimates the DTR with a focus on prioritizing alignment between the observed treatment trajectory and the one obtained by the optimal regime across decision stages. By relaxing the restriction that the observed trajectory must be fully aligned with the optimal treatments, our approach substantially improves the sample efficiency and stability of IPWE-based methods. In particular, the proposed learning scheme builds a more general framework which includes the popular outcome weighted learning framework as a special case of ours. Moreover, we introduce the notion of stage importance scores along with an attention mechanism to explicitly account for heterogeneity among decision stages. We establish the theoretical properties of the proposed approach, including Fisher consistency and the finite-sample performance bound. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed method in extensive simulated environments and a real case study for the COVID-19 pandemic."

However, estimating the optimal weights typically involves computationally expensive matrix inversion and hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we propose a new covariate shift adaptation method which avoids estimating the weights. The basic idea is to directly work on unlabeled target data, labeled according to the $k$-nearest neighbors in the source dataset. Our analysis reveals that setting $k = 1$ is an optimal choice. This property eliminates the necessity of tuning the hyper-parameter $k$ and leads to a running time quasi-linear in the sample size. Our results include sharp rates of convergence for our estimator, with a tight control of the mean square error and explicit constants. In particular, the variance of our estimator has the same rate of convergence as for standard parametric estimation despite their non-parametric nature. The proposed estimator shares similarities with some matching-based treatment effect estimators used, e.g., in biostatistics, econometrics, and epidemiology. Our experiments show that it achieves drastic reduction in the running time with remarkable accuracy."
"221040","","","https://jmlr.org//papers/volume25/22-1040/22-1040.pdf","","Logistic regression is a key method for modeling the probability of a binary outcome based on a collection of covariates. However, the classical formulation of  logistic regression relies on the independent sampling assumption, which is often violated when the outcomes interact through an underlying network structure, such as over a temporal/spatial domain or on a social network. This necessitates the development of models that can simultaneously handle both the network 'peer-effect' (arising from neighborhood interactions) and the effect of (possibly) high-dimensional covariates. In this paper, we develop a framework for incorporating such dependencies in a high-dimensional logistic regression model by introducing a quadratic interaction term, as in the Ising model, designed to capture the pairwise interactions from the underlying network. The resulting model can also be viewed as an Ising model, where the node-dependent external fields linearly encode the high-dimensional covariates. We propose a penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method for estimating the network peer-effect and the effect of the covariates (the regression coefficients), which, in addition to handling the high-dimensionality of the parameters, conveniently avoids the computational intractability of the maximum likelihood approach. Under various standard regularity conditions, we show that the corresponding estimate attains the classical high-dimensional rate of consistency. In particular, our results imply that even under network dependence it is possible to consistently estimate the model parameters at the same rate as in classical (independent) logistic regression, when the true parameter is sparse and the underlying network is not too dense. Consequently,  we  derive  the rates of consistency of our proposed estimator for various  natural  graph  ensembles,  such  as bounded degree graphs, sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graphs, and stochastic block models. We also develop an efficient algorithm for computing the estimates and validate our theoretical results in numerical experiments.

To achieve optimal classification rules for both scenarios, we introduce two novel tensor formulations of the discriminant coefficients and corresponding regularization strategies. For joint classification, we propose an overlapping group lasso penalty and a blockwise coordinate descent algorithm to efficiently compute the joint discriminant coefficient tensors.

In this paper, we instead directly formulate diffusion-based generative models in infinite dimensions and apply them to the generative modelling of functions. We prove that our formulations are well posed in the infinite-dimensional setting and provide dimension-independent distance bounds from the sample to the target measure. Using our theory, we also develop guidelines for the design of infinite-dimensional diffusion models. For image distributions, these guidelines are in line with current canonical choices. For other distributions, however, we can improve upon these canonical choices.

This method relies on the equality between the order of the HMM and the rank of a specific integral operator. Since only the empirical counter-part of the singular values of the operator can be obtained, a thresholding procedure is proposed. At a non-asymptotic level, an upper-bound on the probability of overestimating the order of the HMM is provided. At an asymptotic level, the consistency of the estimator is established. In addition, we introduce a general heuristic that can be successfully applied to several problems in spectral analysis for designing a data-driven procedure for the threshold. The approach has the advantage of not requiring any knowledge of an upper-bound on the order of the HMM. Moreover, different types of data (including circular or mixed-type data) can be managed. The relevance of the approach is illustrated on numerical experiments and on real data considering multivariate data with directional variables."

We study a new model of partially observed mean-field games with finitely many players, local action observability, and partial observations of the global state. Specific observation channels considered include (a) global observability, (b) mean-field observability, (c) compressed mean-field observability, and (d) only local observability. We establish conditions under which the control problem of a given agent is equivalent to a fully observed MDP, as well as conditions under which the control problem is equivalent only to a POMDP. Using the connection to MDPs, we prove the existence of perfect equilibrium among memoryless stationary policies under mean-field observability.  Using the connection to POMDPs, we prove convergence of learning iterates obtained by independent learners under any of our observation channels. We interpret the limiting values as subjective value functions, which an agent believes to be relevant to its control problem. These subjective value functions are used to propose subjective Q-equilibrium, a new solution concept whose existence is proved under mean-field or global observability. Furthermore, we provide a decentralized independent learning algorithm, and by adapting the recently developed theory of satisficing paths to allow for subjectivity, we prove that it drives play to subjective Q-equilibrium. Our algorithm is decentralized, in that it uses only local information for learning and allows players to use different, heterogeneous policies during play. As such, it departs from the conventional representative agent approach common to other algorithms for mean-field games."
