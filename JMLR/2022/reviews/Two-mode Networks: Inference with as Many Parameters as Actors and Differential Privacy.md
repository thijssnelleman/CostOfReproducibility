### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

Implementation not given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[4]

(2/2)

The authors use simulated data and specify details and parameter values but not the implementation. In 5.2 the authors use UC irvine forum network data and provide a citation and a descritpion but no direct link and more information would be welcome.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors provide experiments with two settings of the privacy parameter which is motivated theoretically.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

Tha uathors measure coverage with 95% confidence interval. Not every metric reported in table 1 is very clear. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[6]

Requries expertise on graph data and differential privacy.
