### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors publish their implementation online (https://github.com/edensaig/suggest-breaks). In the readme they state installation instructions and index the repository structure. The code has an acceptable amount of comments.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(2/2)

The authors use two public data sets which they cite, provide description/statistics on and state how they treat the data. Direct links are in appendix C.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors discuss the hyperparameters in appendix C.4. For some values they refer to the 'default values'. No acquisition method specified. Its a bit unclear if the full space and paramter values have been given due to the summary missing/being in text.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors measure procentual improvement of 'accuracy' (never clearly stated). Data partitioning is stated in appendix C.1. The authors state there they repeated the experiment 10 times with different seeds and report the average results with 95% t-dist confidence intervals as variation.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[2]

Requries expertise in user engagement optimisation and recommender systems.
