### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[8]

The authors state the framework used for the implementation. The pipeline of the method can be seen in figure 2 with detail. The implementation is not shared.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(3/3)

The authors use three data sets, provide citations on them, describe them briefly with key statistics, but direct links are missing.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[8]

The authors conduct a hyper-parameter sensitivity analysis in 4.3. Its unclear what the considered HP space is or what the values are per experiment. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

The authors details the metric used in equation 9 with description. There are mentions of training procedures but no specification on training/test sets. The results are single run.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[8]

Requires expertise on universal domain adaptation.
