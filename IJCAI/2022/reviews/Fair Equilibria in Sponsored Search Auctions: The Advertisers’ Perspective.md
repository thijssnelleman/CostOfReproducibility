### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors provide no details on their implementation.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[10]

(0/1)

The authors construct their own real-world dataset ' through logs of a large internet advertising company'. No details on acquisition, features, distributions or other details regarding statistics are given.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[5]

The authors state various semantic parameter values in section six for their regret minimisation, however it is difficult to oversee if all requries parameters are there as some information is only noted/cited.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

The authors evaluate the method 20 times and present the results averaged with standard deviations. As a metric they use revenue loss and expected values. They analyse the equilibirium of the method/agents overtime. It requires some domain knowledge to understand the details of the experiment/presented results.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires expertise in MAS/game theory, as well as good practical skills regarding data analysis/collection as a similar data set will need to be found in order to reproduce the work.
