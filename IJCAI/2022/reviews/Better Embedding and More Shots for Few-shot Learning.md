### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

No implementation is given. Figure 1 gives a high level overview of the method.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(3/3)

The authors state they evaluate three popular datasets, each of which they provide a citation on and present details/statistics in table 1. Direct links / descriptions are missing.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[3]

The authors state various hyperparameter values in 4.2. No configurations space is clearly stated, nor is an acquisition strategy specified making it difficult to determine if all needed values are presented and to defend against the strategy / budgetary constraints.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state they present average accuracy with 95% confidence interval on 600 random tasks in section 4.1. There is also a statement on datasets splits in table 1 suggesting they are static but no further mention on this is made making it unclear on which set results are being reported on.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[3]

Requires an understanding of few shot learning.
