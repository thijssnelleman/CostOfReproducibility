### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not publish their implementation. In algorithm 1 they present pseudo code on their method.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(0/1)

The authors use a simulator for their first experiment, and a human experiment for the second. They describe the simulator in detail with its parameters in 4.1, but do not share the implementation. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[7]

The authors state two parameters in algorithm 1. Various parameter values are stated in 4.1 and for 'the choice of beta' they refer to the missing appendix. Its unclear what the exact parameter space is the authors consider and the parameters stated in algorithm 1 are not mentioned.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state they generate 1k environments from their simulator and report the average results. The variance is not stated. The authors use simulator specifc metrics. Data split does not apply. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requries practical experience MDP.
