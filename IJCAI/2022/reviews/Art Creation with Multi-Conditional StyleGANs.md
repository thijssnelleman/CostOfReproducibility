### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide their implementation. No details regarding the implementation given.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[6]

(0/1)

The authors compile a dataset in their work. they take an existing dataset (which they cite and describe) and enhance it by crawling a second data source (which they provide a direct link to). A summary on the new dataset is presented in table 1 including an example. The author provide no publishing details on their dataset. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[7]

The authors state 'All GANs are trained with default parameters'. It is not clear what these values are. The parameter space is not given. The acquisition method would in this case be empirical/hand selection by using default values.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors state the metrics they used in section 6.1 with formulas, explanations and citations.  Train/test does not apply. Aggregation is specified per metric. Authors state they produce 'over 50k' examples for the analysis.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[3]

Requires expertise on generative AI and GANs.
