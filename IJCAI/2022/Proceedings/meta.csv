In medical residency match, each hospital accepts a limited number of doctors. Such capacity constraints are typically given in advance. However, such exogenous constraints can compromise the welfare of the doctors; some popular hospitals inevitably dismiss some of their favorite doctors. Meanwhile, it is often the case that the hospitals are also benefited to accept a few extra doctors. To tackle the problem, we propose an anytime method that the upper confidence tree searches the space of capacity expansions, each of which has a resident-optimal stable assignment that the deferred acceptance method finds. Constructing a good search tree representation significantly boosts the performance of the proposed method. Our simulation shows that the proposed method identifies an almost optimal capacity expansion with a significantly smaller computational budget than exact methods based on mixed-integer programming.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0001.pdf"

Envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) criterion (which requires that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent after the removal of any single good) is known to be a remarkable analogue of envy-freeness when the resource is a set of indivisible goods.In this paper, we investigate EFX  for restricted additive valuations, that is, every good has a non-negative value, and every agent is interested in only some of the goods.We introduce a natural relaxation of EFX called EFkX which requires that no agent envies another agent after the removal of any k goods. Our main contribution is an algorithm that finds a complete (i.e., no good is discarded) EF2X allocation for restricted additive valuations. In our algorithm we devise new concepts, namely configuration and envy-elimination that might be of independent interest. We also use our new tools to find an EFX allocation for restricted additive valuations that discards at most n/2 -1 goods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0003.pdf"

A benevolent external party wants to help the agents to make better decisions, i.e., select the majority-preferred option for as many issues as possible. This party may have one of the following tools at its disposal: (1) educating some of the agents, so as to enable them to vote correctly on all issues, (2) appointing a subset of highly competent agents to make decisions on behalf of the entire group, or (3) guiding the agents on how to delegate their votes to other agents, in a way that is consistent with the agents' opinions.

The auction mechanism has complete knowledge of the actual state of nature, and it can send signals to bidders so as to disclose information about the state and increase revenue. For instance, a state may collectively encode some features of the user that are known to the mechanism only, since the latter has access to data sources unaccessible to the bidders. We study the problem of computing how the mechanism should send signals to bidders in order to maximize revenue. While this problem has already been addressed in the easier setting of second-price auctions, to the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to explore ad auctions with more than one slot. In this paper, we focus on public signaling and VCG mechanisms, under which bidders truthfully report their valuations. We start with a negative result, showing that, in general, the problem does not admit a PTAS unless P = NP, even when bidders' valuations are known to the mechanism. The rest of the paper is devoted to settings in which such negative result can be circumvented. First, we prove that, with known valuations, the problem can indeed be solved in polynomial time when either the number of states d or the number of slots m is fixed. Moreover, in the same setting, we provide an FPTAS for the case in which bidders are single minded, but d and m can be arbitrary. Then, we switch to the random valuations setting, in which these are randomly drawn according to some probability distribution. In this case, we show that the problem admits an FPTAS, a PTAS, and a QPTAS, when, respectively, d is fixed, m is fixed, and bidders' valuations are bounded away from zero.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0006.pdf"

This enables existing results that study mixed strategies (randomized allocation algorithms) to adopt a compact representation of the mixed strategies.In this work, we initiate the study of mixed strategies for the security games in which the targets can have different defending requirements. In contrast to the case of uniform defending requirement, for which an optimal mixed strategy can be computed efficiently, we show that computing the optimal mixed strategy is NP-hard for the general defending requirements setting. However, we show that strong upper and lower bounds for the optimal mixed strategy defending result can be derived. We propose an efficient close-to-optimal Patching algorithm that computes mixed strategies that use only few pure strategies. We also study the setting when the game is played on a network and resource sharing is enabled between neighboring targets. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in several large real-world datasets.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0007.pdf"

In this paper, we consider a generalization of this model where each agent’s utilities are drawn independently from a distribution specific to the agent. We show that envy-free and Pareto-optimal allocations are likely to exist in this asymmetric model when m=Ω(n log n), which is tight up to a log log gap that also remains open in the symmetric subsetting.

While envy-free allocations of indivisible goods are not guaranteed to exist, envy-freeness can be achieved by additionally providing some subsidy to the agents. These subsidies can be alternatively viewed as a divisible good (money) that is fractionally assigned among the agents to realize an envy-free outcome. In this setup, we bound the subsidy required to attain envy-freeness among agents with dichotomous valuations, i.e., among agents whose marginal value for any good is either zero or one.  We prove that, under dichotomous valuations, there exists an allocation that achieves envy-freeness with a per-agent subsidy of either 0 or 1. Furthermore, such an envy-free solution can be computed efficiently in the standard value-oracle model. Notably, our results hold for general dichotomous valuations and, in particular, do not require the (dichotomous) valuations to be additive, submodular, or even subadditive. Also, our subsidy bounds are tight and provide a linear (in the number of agents) factor improvement over the bounds known for general monotone valuations.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0009.pdf"

Our model identifies key aspects related to strategic adaptation and the challenges that an institution could face as it attempts to provide explanations. Resorting to an agent-based approach, our model scrutinizes: i) the impact of transparency in explanations, ii) the interaction between faking behavior and detection capacity and iii) the role of behavior imitation. We find that the risks of transparent explanations are alleviated if effective methods to detect faking behaviors are in place. Furthermore, we observe that behavioral imitation --- as often happens across societies --- can alleviate malicious adaptation and contribute to accuracy, even after transparent explanations.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0010.pdf"

However, sociological polls suggest that real-world agents are actually favoring mixed-type neighborhoods, and hence should be modeled via non-monotone utility functions. To address this, we study Swap Schelling Games with single-peaked utility functions. Our main finding is that tolerance, i.e., agents favoring fifty-fifty neighborhoods or being in the minority, is necessary for equilibrium existence on almost regular or bipartite graphs.

Next, we analyze the performances of these equilibria with respect to a social objective function defined as a convex combination, parametrized by a value λ∈[0,1], of the costs yielded by the untruthfulness of the declared opinions and the total cost of social pressure. We prove bounds on both the price of anarchy and the price of stability which show that, for not-too-extreme values of λ, performance at equilibrium are very close to optimal ones.

When agents rank the set of alternatives, prior work identifies near-optimal voting rules for selecting one or more alternatives. However, ranking all the alternatives is prohibitive when there are many alternatives. In this work, we consider the setting where each agent ranks only her t favorite alternatives and identify almost tight bounds on the best possible distortion when selecting a single alternative or a committee of alternatives of a given size k.

In order to study properties such as efficiency, strategyproofness, and participation for SDSs, preferences over alternatives are typically lifted to preferences over lotteries using the notion of stochastic dominance (SD). However, requiring strategyproofness or strict participation with respect to this preference extension only leaves room for rather undesirable SDSs such as random dictatorships. Hence, we focus on the natural but little understood pairwise comparison (PC) preference extension, which postulates that one lottery is preferred to another if the former is more likely to return a preferred outcome. In particular, we settle three open questions raised by Brandt in Rolling the dice: Recent results in probabilistic social choice (2017): (i) there is no Condorcet-consistent SDS that satisfies PC-strategyproofness; (ii) there is no anonymous and neutral SDS that satisfies PC-efficiency and PC-strategyproofness; and (iii) there is no anonymous and neutral SDS that satisfies PC-efficiency and strict PC-participation.

To accomplish a multi-stage task, agents have to achieve cooperation on different subtasks. Exploring the collaborative patterns of different subtasks and the sequence of completing the subtasks leads to an explosion in the search space, which poses great challenges to policy learning. Existing works designed for single-stage tasks where agents learn to cooperate only once usually suffer from low sample efficiency in multi-stage tasks as agents explore aimlessly. Inspired by human’s improving cooperation through goal consistency, we propose Multi-Agent Goal Consistency (MAGIC) framework to improve sample efficiency for learning in multi-stage tasks. MAGIC adopts a goal-oriented actor-critic model to learn both local and global views of goal cognition, which helps agents understand the task at the goal level so that they can conduct targeted exploration accordingly. Moreover, to improve exploration efficiency, MAGIC employs two-level goal consistency training to drive agents to formulate a consistent goal cognition. Experimental results show that MAGIC significantly improves sample efficiency and facilitates cooperation among agents compared with state-of-art MARL algorithms in several challenging multistage tasks.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0025.pdf"

First, we show that two-crossing elections can be recognized in polynomial time, by reduction to the well-studied consecutive ones problem. Single-crossing elections exhibit a transitive majority relation, from which many important results follow. On the other hand, we show that the classical Debord-McGarvey theorem can still be proven two-crossing, implying that any weighted majority tournament is inducible by a two-crossing election. This shows that many voting rules are NP-hard under two-crossing elections, including Kemeny and Slater. This is in contrast to the single-crossing case and outlines an important complexity boundary between single- and two-crossing. Subsequently, we show that for two-crossing elections the Young scores of all candidates can be computed in polynomial time, by formulating a totally unimodular linear program. Finally, we consider the Chamberlin-Courant rule with arbitrary disutilities and show that a winning committee can be computed in polynomial time, using an approach based on dynamic programming.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0030.pdf"

While this assumption is reasonable in some circumstances, it is less plausible when the agents are not co-designed. In this paper, we present a new approach to multi-agent intention scheduling in which agents predict the actions of other agents based on a high-level specification of the tasks performed by an agent in the form of a reward machine (RM) rather than on its (assumed) program. We show how a reward machine can be used to generate tree and rollout policies for an MCTS-based scheduler.

If one is interested in ranking players of a game which is stable, re-computing the power indices when the coalitional worths slightly fluctuate or are uncertain becomes useless.  Bivalued games are easy examples of games stable for any power index which is linear.  Among general games, we characterize those that are stable for a given linear index.  Note that the Shapley and Banzhaf scores, frequently used in AI, are particular semivalues, and all semivalues are linear indices.

An agent may adopt the trait of one of its neighbors at any time, while the invasion bias r quantifies the stochastic preference towards (r>1) or against (r<1) adopting A over B. Success is measured in terms of the fixation probability, i.e., the probability that eventually all agents have adopted the mutant trait A. In this paper we study the problem of fixation probability maximization under this model: given a budget k, find a set of k agents to initiate the invasion that maximizes the fixation probability. We show that the problem is NP-hard for both regimes r>1 and r<1, while the latter case is also inapproximable within any multiplicative factor that is independent of r. On the positive side, we show that when r>1, the optimization function is submodular and thus can be greedily approximated within a factor 1-1/e.

[2015, https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/2772879.2773411] for the scoring rule First-Last, which is defined by (1, 0, ..., 0, -1).

So on the one hand, if CCRV for First-Last is NP-complete then RP = NP, which is extremely unlikely. On the other hand, showing that CCRV for First-Last is in P would also show that Exact Perfect Bipartite Matching is in P, which would solve a well-studied 40-year-old open problem.Considering RP as an option for classifying problems can also help classify problems that until now had escaped classification.

We model this situation by assuming that each contestant has an ability, which we interpret as its probability of submitting a high-quality submission. After the contestants decide whether or not they want to participate, the organizer of the contest needs to break ties between the high quality submissions. A common assumption in the literature is that the exact tie-breaking rule does not matter as long as ties are broken consistently. However, we show that the choice of the tie-breaking rule may have significant implications on the efficiency of the contest.Our results highlight both qualitative and quantitative differences between various deterministic tie-breaking rules. Perhaps counterintuitively, we show that in many scenarios, the utility of the organizer is maximized when ties are broken in favor of successful players with lower ability. Nevertheless, we show that the natural rule of choosing the submission of the successful player with the highest ability guarantees the organizer at least 1/3 of its utility under any tie-breaking rule. To complement these results, we provide an upper bound of  Hn ~ \ln(n) on the price of anarchy (the ratio between the social welfare of the optimal solution and the social welfare of the Nash equilibrium). We show that this ratio is tight when ties are broken in favor of players with higher abilities.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0044.pdf"

Specifically, we generalize the recently proposed accomplice manipulation model (where a man misreports on behalf of a woman) along two complementary dimensions: (a) the two for one model, with a pair of misreporting agents (man and woman) and a single beneficiary (the misreporting woman), and (b) the one for all model, with one misreporting agent (man) and a coalition of beneficiaries (all women). Our main contribution is to develop polynomial-time algorithms for finding an optimal manipulation in both settings. We obtain these results despite the fact that an optimal one for all strategy fails to be inconspicuous, while it is unclear whether an optimal two for one strategy satisfies the inconspicuousness property. We also study the conditions under which stability of the resulting matching is preserved. Experimentally, we show that two-sided manipulations are more frequently available and offer better quality matches than their one-sided counterparts.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0046.pdf"

Each candidate starts with a score equal to his number of first-place votes.These scores are then gradually decreased via an n-round veto process in which a candidate drops out when his score reaches zero. One after the other, voters decrement the score of their bottom choice among the standing candidates, and the last standing candidate wins.We give a one-paragraph proof that this voting rule achieves distortion 3.This rule is also immensely practical, and it only makes two queries to each voter, so it has low communication overhead.We also show that a straightforward extension can be used to give a constructive proof of the more general Ranking-Matching Lemma of Gkatzelis et al.We also generalize Plurality Veto into a class of randomized voting rules in the following way: Plurality veto is run only for k < n rounds; then, a candidate is chosen with probability proportional to his residual score.This general rule interpolates between Random Dictatorship (for k=0) and Plurality Veto (for k=n-1), and k controls the variance of the output.We show that for all k, this rule has expected distortion at most 3.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0050.pdf"

To model this problem, the existing literature on matching with externalities permits agents to provide complete and total rankings over matchings based off of both their own and their affiliates' matches. This complete ordering restriction is unrealistic, and further the model may have an empty core. To address this, we introduce the Dichotomous Affiliate Stable Matching (DASM) Problem, where agents' preferences indicate dichotomous acceptance or rejection of another agent in the marketplace, both for themselves and their affiliates. We also assume the agent's preferences over entire matchings are determined by a general weighted valuation function of their (and their affiliates') matches. Our results are threefold: (1) we use a human study to show that real-world matching rankings follow our assumed valuation function; (2) we prove that there always exists a stable solution by providing an efficient, easily-implementable algorithm that finds such a solution; and (3) we experimentally validate the efficiency of our algorithm versus a linear-programming-based approach.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0051.pdf"

We consider a system in which an agent receives an update, typically an insertion or deletion, of some information upon visiting a node. On request, the agent needs to output hot information, i.e., with the net occurrence above certain frequency threshold. A desired time and memory complexity of such agent should be poly-logarithmic in the number of visited nodes and inversely proportional to the frequency threshold.

In this work, we exhibit classes of network topologies for which we prove that the expected time for consensus on the superior opinion can be exponential. This answers an open conjecture in the literature. In contrast, we show that in all cubic graphs, convergence occurs after a polynomial number of rounds for every α.We rely on new structural graph properties by characterizing the opinion formation in terms of multiple domination, stable and decreasing structures in graphs, providing an interplay between bias, consensus and network structure.

The computational task is to find if there exists a collection of disjoint cycles and paths starting from altruistic donor vertices of length at most l_c and l_p respectively that covers at least some specific number t of non-altruistic vertices (patients).

First, we formally define the notion of robustness, as well as the robust MSSG model. Then, for the non-cooperative setting, we prove the existence of a robust approximate equilibrium in any such game, and provide an efficient construction thereof. For the cooperative setting, we show that any such game admits a robust approximate (alpha) core, and provide an efficient construction thereof.

To overcome this challenge, we carefully select an approximately optimal round-robin order. Applying a relaxation of submodularity, γ-weak submodularity, we show that greedily inserting papers into an order yields a (1+γ²)-approximation to the maximum welfare attainable by our round-robin mechanism under any order.

We validate our model using complex social dilemmas that are popular in recent multiagent RL and find that agents divided into teams develop cooperative pro-social policies despite incentives to not cooperate.

When a group of competing advertisers is managed by a common agency, many forms of collusion, such as bid rigging, can be implemented by coordinating bidding strategies, dramatically increasing advertisers' value. We study the problem of finding bids and monetary transfers maximizing the utility of a group of colluders, under GSP and VCG mechanisms. First, we introduce an abstract bid optimization problem---called weighted utility problem (WUP)---, which is useful in proving our results. We show that the utilities of bidding strategies are related to the length of paths in a directed acyclic weighted graph, whose structure and weights depend on the mechanism under study. This allows us to solve WUP in polynomial time by finding a shortest path of the graph. Next, we switch to our original problem, focusing on two settings that differ for the incentives they allow for. Incentive constraints ensure that colluders do not leave the agency, and they can be enforced by implementing monetary transfers between the agency and the advertisers. In particular, we study the arbitrary transfers setting, where any kind of monetary transfer to and from the advertisers is allowed, and the more realistic limited liability setting, in which no advertiser can be paid by the agency. In the former, we cast the problem as a WUP instance and solve it by our graph-based algorithm, while, in the latter, we formulate it as a linear program with exponentially-many variables efficiently solvable by applying the ellipsoid algorithm to its dual. This requires to solve a suitable separation problem in polynomial time, which can be done by reducing it to the weighted utility problem a WUP instance.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0066.pdf"

In this work, we present a simple yet effective method of learning an end-to-end negotiation strategy from historical negotiation data.

Additionally, we also propose an online method of detecting and measuring such changes in the utility functions.

Egalitarianism, an important objective in PB, has not received much attention in the context of indivisible PB. This paper addresses this gap through a detailed study of a natural egalitarian rule, Maxmin Participatory Budgeting (MPB), in the context of indivisible PB. Our study is in two parts: (1) computational (2) axiomatic.  In the first part, we prove that MPB is computationally hard and give pseudo-polynomial time and polynomial-time algorithms when parameterized by certain well-motivated parameters. We propose an algorithm that achieves for MPB, additive approximation guarantees for restricted spaces of instances and empirically show that our algorithm in fact gives exact optimal solutions on real-world PB datasets. We also establish an upper bound on the approximation ratio achievable for MPB by the family of exhaustive strategy-proof PB algorithms.

For safety testing, our framework utilizes a search algorithm that searches for a reference trace that solves the RL task. The backtracking states of the search, called boundary states, pose safety-critical situations. We create safety test-suites that evaluate how well the RL agent escapes safety-critical situations near these boundary states. For robust performance testing, we create a diverse set of traces via fuzz testing.

Existing Max-Sum extensions to continuous multiagent coordination domains require additional assumptions regarding the form of the factors, such as access to the gradient, or the ability to model them as continuous piecewise linear functions.

Second, when there is spare capacity, we identify a more general class of strategy proof mechanisms that interpolates smoothly between INNERPOINT and ENDPOINT which are anonymous and Pareto optimal.

Recently, researchers have proposed ML-based mechanisms that outperform traditional mechanisms while reducing preference elicitation costs for agents. However, one major shortcoming of the ML algorithms that were used is their disregard of important prior knowledge about agents' preferences. To address this, we introduce monotone-value neural networks (MVNNs), which are designed to capture combinatorial valuations, while enforcing monotonicity and normality. On a technical level, we prove that our MVNNs are universal in the class of monotone and normalized value functions, and we provide a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) formulation to make solving MVNN-based winner determination problems (WDPs) practically feasible. We evaluate our MVNNs experimentally in spectrum auction domains.

We show that controlling elections in this model is, in general, NP-hard, whether issues are binary or real-valued. However, we demonstrate that critical to intractability is the diversity of opinions on issues exhibited by the voting public. When voter views lack diversity, and we can instead group them into a small number of categories---for example, as a result of political polarization---the election control problem can be solved in polynomial time in the number of issues and candidates for arbitrary scoring rules.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0079.pdf"

However, they do not explicitly evaluate each message's value, failing to learn an efficient communication protocol in more complex scenarios. To tackle this issue, we model the teammates of an agent as a message coalition and calculate the Shapley Message Value (SMV) of each agent within it. SMV reflects the contribution of each message to an agent and redundant messages can be spotted in this way effectively. On top of that, we design a novel framework named Shapley Message Selector (SMS), which learns to predict the SMVs of teammates for an agent solely based on local information so that the agent can only query those teammates with positive SMVs. Empirically, we demonstrate that our method can prune redundant messages and achieve comparable or better performance in various multi-agent cooperative scenarios than full communication settings and existing strong baselines.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0082.pdf"

In MACC, agents first learn representations for subtasks from their local information and then implement an attention mechanism to concentrate on the most relevant ones.

However, in multiplayer games, computing a Nash equilibrium is generally hard, and the equilibria are not exchangeable, which makes players face the problem of selecting one of many different Nash equilibria. In this paper, we focus on an alternative solution concept in zero-sum multiplayer extensive-form games called Team-Maxmin Equilibrium (TME). It is a Nash equilibrium that maximizes each team member’s utility. As TME is unique in general, it avoids the equilibrium selection problem. However, it is still difficult (FNP- hard) to find a TME. Computing it can be formulated as a non-convex program, but existing algorithms are capable of solving this program for only very small games. In this paper, we first refine the complexity result for computing a TME by using a correlation plan to show that a TME can be found in polynomial time in a specific class of games according to our boundary for complexity. Second, we propose an efficient correlation-based algorithm to solve the non-convex program for TME in games not belonging to this class. The algorithm combines two special correlation plans based on McCormick envelopes for convex relaxation and von Stengel-Forges polytope for correlated equilibria.

For these objectives, we show that existing classical mechanisms (e.g., median) and new group-based mechanisms provide bounded approximation ratios, where the group-based mechanisms can achieve better ratios.

Given an image with a set of objects, our goal is to determine if an object is inconsistent with the contextual relations and detect the OOC object with a bounding box. In this work, we consider common contextual relations such as co-occurrence relations, the relative size of an object with respect to other objects, and the position of the object in the scene. We posit that contextual cues are useful to determine object labels for in-context objects and inconsistent context cues are detrimental to determining object labels for out-of-context objects. To realize this hypothesis, we propose a graph contextual reasoning network (GCRN) to detect OOC objects. GCRN consists of two separate graphs to predict object labels based on the contextual cues in the image: 1) a representation graph to learn object features based on the neighboring objects and 2) a context graph to explicitly capture contextual cues from the neighboring objects. GCRN explicitly captures the contextual cues to improve the detection of in-context objects and identify objects that violate contextual relations. In order to evaluate our approach, we create a large-scale dataset by adding OOC object instances to the COCO images. We also evaluate on recent OCD benchmark. Our results show that GCRN outperforms competitive baselines in detecting OOC objects and correctly detecting in-context objects.

This paper investigates theoretically explainers that provide reasons behind decisions independently of instances.  Its contributions are fourfold. The first is to lay the foundations of such explainers by proposing key axioms, i.e., desirable properties they would satisfy. Two axioms are incompatible leading to two subsets. The second contribution consists of demonstrating that the first subset of axioms characterizes a family of explainers that return sufficient reasons while the second characterizes a family that provides necessary reasons. This sheds light on the axioms which distinguish the two types of reasons. As a third contribution, the paper introduces various explainers of both families, and fully characterizes some of them. Those explainers make use of the whole feature space. The fourth contribution is a family of explainers that generate explanations from  finite datasets (subsets of the feature space). This family, seen as an abstraction of Anchors and LIME, violates some axioms including one which prevents incorrect explanations.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0090.pdf"

To achieve this, we propose Jacobian frequency regularization for models' Jacobians to have a larger ratio of low-frequency components. Through experiments on four image datasets, we show that biasing classifiers towards low (high)-frequency components can bring performance gain against high (low)-frequency corruption and adversarial perturbation, albeit with a tradeoff in performance for low (high)-frequency corruption.

Furthermore, we hypothesize that (1) the spectral density, (2) class consistency directly affect the frequency bias. Specifically, our investigations verify that the spectral density of datasets mainly affects the learning priority, while the class consistency mainly affects the feature discrimination.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0101.pdf"

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) based framework for Transformer explanation via attention matrix, namely AttExplainer. The RL agent learns to perform step-by-step masking operations by observing the change in attention matrices.

To overcome these issues, we propose MAB-RFL, a new method for robust aggregation in FL. By modelling the client selection as an extended multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, we propose an adaptive client selection strategy to choose honest clients that are more likely to contribute high-quality updates. We then propose two approaches to identify malicious updates from sybil and non-sybil attacks, based on which rewards for each client selection decision can be accurately evaluated to discourage malicious behaviors. MAB-RFL achieves a satisfying balance between exploration and exploitation on the potential benign clients. Extensive experimental results show that MAB-RFL outperforms existing defenses in three attack scenarios under different percentages of attackers.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0106.pdf"

However, the existing studies on proactive DeepFake defense via injecting adversarial noises are not robust, which could be easily bypassed by employing simple image reconstruction revealed in a recent study MagDR. In this paper, we investigate the vulnerability of the existing forgery techniques and propose a novel anti-forgery technique that helps users protect the shared facial images from attackers who are capable of applying the popular forgery techniques.

Compared with adversarial attacks on image classification, performing adversarial attacks on graphs is more challenging because of the discrete and non-differential nature of the adjacent matrix for a graph. In this work, we propose Cluster Attack --- a Graph Injection Attack (GIA) on node classification, which injects fake nodes into the original graph to degenerate the performance of graph neural networks (GNNs) on certain victim nodes while affecting the other nodes as little as possible. We demonstrate that a GIA problem can be equivalently formulated as a graph clustering problem; thus, the discrete optimization problem of the adjacency matrix can be solved in the context of graph clustering. In particular, we propose to measure the similarity between victim nodes by a metric of Adversarial Vulnerability, which is related to how the victim nodes will be affected by the injected fake node, and to cluster the victim nodes accordingly. Our attack is performed in a practical and unnoticeable query-based black-box manner with only a few nodes on the graphs that can be accessed. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by fooling the node classifiers with only a small number of queries.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0108.pdf"

To help deblur each frame, existing methods usually compress a specific event sequence into a feature tensor with the same size as the corresponding video. However, this strategy neither considers the pixel-level spatial brightness changes nor the temporal correlation between events at each time step, resulting in insufficient use of spatio-temporal information. To address this issue, we propose a new Spatio-Temporal Relation-Attention network (STRA), for the specific event-based video deblurring. Concretely, to utilize spatial consistency between the frame and event, we model the brightness changes as an extra prior to aware blurring contexts in each frame; to record temporal relationship among different events, we develop a temporal memory block to restore long-range dependencies of event sequences continuously. In this way, the complementary information contained in the events and frames, as well as the correlation of neighboring events, can be fully utilized to recover spatial texture from events constantly. Experiments show that our STRA significantly outperforms several competing methods, e.g., on the HQF dataset, our network achieves up to 1.3 dB in terms of PSNR over the most advanced method.

It would be interesting to make use of these existing image-based models in the video iTM task. However, directly transferring the imagebased iTM models to video data without modeling spatial-temporal information remains nontrivial and challenging. Considering both the intra-frame quality and the inter-frame consistency of a video, this article presents a new video iTM method based on a kernel prediction network (KPN), which takes advantage of multi-frame interaction (MFI) module to capture temporal-spatial information for video data. Specifically, a basic encoder-decoder KPN, essentially designed for image iTM, is trained to guarantee the mapping quality within each frame. More importantly, the MFI module is incorporated to capture temporal-spatial context information and preserve the inter-frame consistency by exploiting the correction between adjacent frames. Notably, we can readily extend any existing image iTM models to video iTM ones by involving the proposed MFI module. Furthermore, we propose an inter-frame brightness consistency loss function based on the Gaussian pyramid to reduce the video temporal inconsistency.

The development of generative models enables current GZSL techniques to probe further into the semantic-visual link, culminating in a two-stage form that includes a generator and a classifier. However, existing generation-based methods focus on enhancing the generator's effect while neglecting the improvement of the classifier. In this paper, we first analyze of two properties of the generated pseudo unseen samples: bias and homogeneity. Then, we perform variational Bayesian inference to back-derive the evaluation metrics, which reflects the balance of the seen and unseen classes. As a consequence of our derivation, the aforementioned two properties are incorporated into the classifier training as seen-unseen priors via logit adjustment. The Zero-Shot Logit Adjustment further puts semantic-based classifiers into effect in generation-based GZSL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed technique achieves state-of-the-art when combined with the basic generator, and it can improve various generative Zero-Shot Learning frameworks.

To address this, we design the UARL to exploit the transitional expression between two action periods by uncertainty learning. Specially, we model every frame of actions with an active distribution that represents the probabilities of different actions, which captures the uncertainty of the action and exploits the tendency during the action. We evaluate our method on three popular action prediction datasets: Breakfast, Georgia Tech Egocentric Activities (GTEA), and 50Salads.

Instead of establishing deterministic correspondence with camera projection matrix, we model the mapping relationship between the image and point clouds with a learnable alignment map. This map enables our model to automate the alignment of non-homogenous features in a dynamic and data-driven manner. Specifically, a cross-attention feature alignment module is devised to adaptively aggregate pixel-level image features for each voxel. To enhance the semantic consistency during feature alignment, we also design a self-supervised cross-modal feature interaction module, through which the model can learn feature aggregation with instance-level feature guidance.

In this paper, we propose a novel translation-based unsupervised deformable image registration approach to convert the multi-modal registration problem to a mono-modal one. Specifically, our approach incorporates a discriminator-free translation network to facilitate the training of the registration network and a patchwise contrastive loss to encourage the translation network to preserve object shapes. Furthermore, we propose to replace an adversarial loss, that is widely used in previous multi-modal image registration methods, with a pixel loss in order to integrate the output of translation into the target modality. This leads to an unsupervised method requiring no ground-truth deformation or pairs of aligned images for training. We evaluate four variants of our approach on the public Learn2Reg 2021 datasets.

The self-attention mechanism designed to model long-range dependencies is the key to the success of Transformers.

In this paper, we relieve this issue with a sparse attention mechanism by focusing the most relevant information in the search regions, which enables a much accurate tracking. Furthermore, we introduce a double-head predictor to boost the accuracy of foreground-background classification and regression of target bounding boxes, which further improve the tracking performance.

Having observed de facto frameworks perform feature matching simply using the backbone outputs for target localization, there is no direct feedback from the matching module to the backbone network, especially the shallow layers. Concretely, only the matching module can directly access the target information, while the representation learning of candidate frame is blind to the reference target. Therefore, the accumulated target-irrelevant interference in shallow stages may degrade the feature quality of deeper layers. In this paper, we approach the problem by conducting multiple branch-wise interactions inside the Siamese-like backbone networks (InBN). The core of InBN is a general interaction modeler (GIM) that injects the target information to different stages of the backbone network, leading to better target-perception of candidate feature representation with negligible computation cost. The proposed GIM module and InBN mechanism are general and applicable to different backbone types including CNN and Transformer for improvements, as evidenced on multiple benchmarks. In particular, the CNN version improves the baseline with 3.2/6.9 absolute gains of SUC on LaSOT/TNL2K.

To address this issue, we propose a simple but effective prior - Fourier prior to improve the generalization ability of an image rain removal model. The Fourier prior is a kind of property of rainy images. It is based on a key observation of us - replacing the Fourier amplitude of rainy images with that of clean images greatly suppresses the synthetic and real-world rain streaks. This means the amplitude contains most of the rain streak information and the phase keeps the similar structures of the background. So it is natural for single image rain removal to process the amplitude and phase information of the rainy images separately. In this paper, we develop a two-stage model where the first stage restores the amplitude of rainy images to clean rain streaks, and the second stage restores the phase information to refine fine-grained background structures. Extensive experiments on synthetic rainy data demonstrate the power of Fourier prior. Moreover, when trained on synthetic data, a robust generalization ability to real-world images can also be obtained.

The EGGN learns a mapping from the class-level semantic space to the dense-semantic visual space, thus improving the discriminability of the synthesized dense-semantic unseen visual features.

There are two key aspects to fulfill the association learning: 1) DANet unveils the latent association knowledge between rain streak prediction and background texture recovery, and leverages it as an extra prior via an associated learning module (ALM) to promote the texture recovery. 2) DANet introduces the parametric association constraint for enhancing the compatibility of deraining model with background reconstruction, enabling it to be automatically learned from the training data. Moreover, we observe that the sampled rainy image enjoys the similar distribution to the original one.

The proposed parallel architecture is effective to maintain complementary information since fixed-point arithmetic can be utilized in the quantized network and the lightweightmodel provides precise representations given by a compact channel-pruned network.

Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of test-time adaptation (TTA) on ViT, a technique that has emerged to correct its prediction during test-time by itself. First, we benchmark various test-time adaptation approaches on ViT-B16 and ViT-L16. It is shown that the TTA is effective on ViT and the prior-convention (sensibly selecting modulation parameters) is not necessary when using proper loss function. Based on the observation, we propose a new test-time adaptation method called class-conditional feature alignment (CFA), which minimizes both the class-conditional distribution differences and the whole distribution differences of the hidden representation between the source and target in an online manner. Experiments of image classification tasks on common corruption (CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C) and domain adaptation (digits datasets and ImageNet-Sketch) show that CFA stably outperforms the existing baselines on various datasets. We also verify that CFA is model agnostic by experimenting on ResNet, MLP-Mixer, and several ViT variants (ViT-AugReg, DeiT, and BeiT). Using BeiT backbone, CFA achieves 19.8% top-1 error rate on ImageNet-C, outperforming the existing test-time adaptation baseline 44.0%.

Existing approaches typically follow the prototype learning paradigm to perform meta-inference, which fails to fully exploit the underlying information from support image-mask pairs, resulting in various segmentation failures, e.g., incomplete objects, ambiguous boundaries, and distractor activation. To this end, we propose a simple yet versatile framework in the spirit of divide-and-conquer. Specifically, a novel self-reasoning scheme is first implemented on the annotated support image, and then the coarse segmentation mask is divided into multiple regions with different properties. Leveraging effective masked average pooling operations, a series of support-induced proxies are thus derived, each playing a specific role in conquering the above challenges. Moreover, we devise a unique parallel decoder structure that integrates proxies with similar attributes to boost the discrimination power. Our proposed approach, named divide-and-conquer proxies (DCP), allows for the development of appropriate and reliable information as a guide at the “episode” level, not just about the object cues themselves.

We investigate the challenging problem of grounding relative directions with end-to-end neural networks. To this end, we provide GRiD-3D, a novel dataset that features relative directions and complements existing visual question answering (VQA) datasets, such as CLEVR, that involve only absolute directions.

Experimental evaluations show that answering questions on relative directions is feasible when questions in the dataset simulate the necessary subtasks for grounding relative directions.

One crucial requirement for stereo image inpainting is stereo consistency.  To achieve it, we propose an Iterative Geometry-Aware Cross Guidance Network (IGGNet). The IGGNet contains two key ingredients, i.e., a Geometry-Aware Attention(GAA) module and an Iterative  Cross Guidance(ICG) strategy. The GAA module relies on the epipolar geometry  cues and learns the geometry-aware guidance from one view to another,  which is beneficial to make the corresponding regions in two views consistent. However, learning guidance from co-existing missing regions is challenging. To address  this  issue,  the  ICG  strategy  is  proposed, which can alternately narrow down the missing regions of the two views in an iterative manner.

In this work, we introduce an end-to-end point-range fusion network (PRNet) that extracts semantic features mainly on the RV and iteratively fuses the RV features back to the 3D points for the final prediction.

Its purpose is to learn an embedding space so that visual data can be embedded in a position close to the corresponding text description. However, there are large intra-class variations in the vision-language data. For example, multiple texts describing the same image may be described from different views, and the descriptions of different views are often dissimilar. The mainstream VSE method embeds samples from the same class in similar positions, which will suppress intra-class variations and lead to inferior generalization performance. This paper proposes a Multi-View Visual Semantic Embedding (MV-VSE) framework, which learns multiple embeddings for one visual data and explicitly models intra-class variations. To optimize MV-VSE, a multi-view upper bound loss is proposed, and the multi-view embeddings are jointly optimized while retaining intra-class variations. MV-VSE is plug-and-play and can be applied to various VSE models and loss functions without excessively increasing model complexity.

In this paper, we show that exploiting large scale training set and adapting to real hazy images are two critical issues in learning effective deep dehazing models.

It's very difficult for models to learn in such settings. In this paper, we investigate the possibilities of only using reflectance images for supervision during training. In this way, the demand for labeled data is greatly reduced. In order to achieve this goal, we take a deep investigation into the reflectance images. We find that reflectance images are actually comprised of two components: the flat surfaces with low frequency information, and the boundaries with high frequency details. Then, we propose to disentangle the learning process of the two components of the reflectance images. We argue that through this procedure, the reflectance images can be better modeled, and in the meantime, the shading images, though not supervised, can also achieve decent result. Extensive experiments show that our proposed network outperforms current state-of-the-art results by a large margin on the most challenging real-world IIW dataset.

To reduce the quadratic computation complexity caused by each query attending to all keys/values, various methods have constrained the range of attention  within local regions, where each query only attends to keys/values within a hand-crafted window. However, these hand-crafted window partition mechanisms are data-agnostic and ignore their input content, so it is likely that one query maybe attend to irrelevant keys/values. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Group Attention (DG-Attention), which dynamically divides all queries into multiple groups and selects the most relevant keys/values for each group.  Our DG-Attention can flexibly model more relevant dependencies without any spatial constraint that is used in hand-crafted window based attention. Built on the DG-Attention, we develop a general vision transformer backbone named Dynamic Group Transformer (DGT). Extensive experiments show that our models can outperform the state-of-the-art methods on multiple common vision tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0166.pdf"

The latter is because the optimal transportation map is discontinuous, but DNNs can only approximate continuous ones. One way to solve the problem is to introduce multiple discriminators or generators. However, their impacts are limited because the cost function of each component is the same. That is, they are homogeneous. In contrast, multiple discriminators with different cost functions can yield various gradients for the generator, which indicates we can use them to search for more transportation maps in the latent space. Inspired by this, we have proposed a framework to combat the mode collapse problem, containing multiple discriminators with different cost functions, named CES-GAN. Unfortunately, it may also lead to the generator being hard to train because the performance between discriminators is unbalanced, according to the Cannikin Law. Thus, a gradient selecting mechanism is also proposed to pick up proper gradients. We provide mathematical statements to prove our assumptions and conduct extensive experiments to verify the performance. The results show that CES-GAN is lightweight and more effective for fighting against the mode collapse problem than similar works.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0167.pdf"

To reduce these two kinds of errors, we propose a new biological instance segmentation framework based on a superpixel-guided graph, which consists of two stages, i.e., superpixel-guided graph construction and superpixel agglomeration. Specifically, the first stage generates enough superpixels as graph nodes to avoid over-merge, and extracts node and edge features to construct an initialized graph. The second stage agglomerates superpixels into instances based on the relationship of graph nodes predicted by a graph neural network (GNN). To solve over-segmentation and prevent introducing additional over-merge, we specially design two loss functions to supervise the GNN, i.e., a repulsion-attraction (RA) loss to better distinguish the relationship of nodes in the feature space, and a maximin agglomeration score (MAS) loss to pay more attention to crucial edge classification.

Our approach first encodes each AU's activation status and its association with other AUs into a node feature. Then, it learns a pair of multi-dimensional edge features to describe multiple task-specific relationship cues between each pair of AUs. During both node and edge feature learning, our approach also considers the influence of the unique facial display on AUs' relationship by taking the full face representation as an input.

Specifically, frames are usually evenly sampled, which may miss important frames. On the other hand, the heuristic model simply encodes the equally treated frames in sequence, which results in the lack of both long-term and short-term temporal modeling and interaction. To alleviate these limitations, we take advantage of the compressed domain knowledge and propose a long-short term Cross-Transformer (LSTC) for few-shot video classification. For short terms, the motion vector (MV) contains temporal cues and reflects the importance of each frame. For long terms, a video can be natively divided into a sequence of GOPs (Group Of Picture). Using this compressed domain knowledge helps to obtain a more accurate spatial-temporal feature space. Consequently, we design the long-short term selection module, short-term module, and long-term module to comprise the LSTC. Long-short term selection is performed to select informative compressed domain data. Long/short-term modules are utilized to sufficiently exploit the temporal information so that the query and support can be well-matched by cross-attention.

Those kernels consist of spatial kernels generated from PAN images containing rich spatial details and spectral kernels generated from LR-MS images containing abundant spectral information. The kernel generating process is specially designed to extract information discriminately and effectively. Furthermore, the kernels are learned in a pixel-by-pixel manner to characterize different information in distinct areas. Extensive experimental results indicate that ADKNet outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) pansharpening methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments, in the meanwhile only with about 60,000 network parameters.

Specifically, to fully exploit skeleton features within each skeleton sequence, we first devise a masked prototype contrastive learning (MPC) scheme to cluster the most typical skeleton features (skeleton prototypes) from different subsequences randomly masked from raw sequences, and contrast the inherent similarity between skeleton features and different prototypes to learn discriminative skeleton representations without using any label. Then, considering that different subsequences within the same sequence usually enjoy strong correlations due to the nature of motion continuity, we propose the masked intra-sequence contrastive learning (MIC) to capture intra-sequence pattern consistency between subsequences, so as to encourage learning more effective skeleton representations for person re-ID.

Instead of straightly stacking cascaded feature reconstruction blocks, the proposed IDPT designs the pyramid encoder/decoder Transformer architecture to extract coarse and detailed facial textures respectively, while the relationship between the dual pyramid Transformers is further explored by a bottom pyramid feature extractor. The pyramid encoder/decoder structure is devised to adapt various characteristics of textures in different spatial spaces hierarchically. A novel fusing modulation module is inserted in each spatial layer to guide the refinement of detailed texture by the corresponding coarse texture, while fusing the shallow-layer coarse feature and corresponding deep-layer detailed feature simultaneously.

We instantiate our framework into two algorithms: a gradient-based attack that introduces constraints in the loss function to maximize, and a multi-objective search algorithm that aims for misclassification, perturbation minimization, and constraint satisfaction. We show that our approach is effective in four different domains, with a success rate of up to 100%, where state-of-the-art attacks fail to generate a single feasible example.

M-SCAN approximates a super-resolution map of where humans are likely to interact on the way to their goals and produces multi-scale attention maps.

To tackle this problem, we develop a brand-new DG variant, namely Dynamic Domain Generalization (DDG), in which the model learns to twist the network parameters to adapt to the data from different domains. Specifically, we leverage a meta-adjuster to twist the network parameters based on the static model with respect to different data from different domains. In this way, the static model is optimized to learn domain-shared features, while the meta-adjuster is designed to learn domain-specific features. To enable this process, DomainMix is exploited to simulate data from diverse domains during teaching the meta-adjuster to adapt to the agnostic target domains.

Many existing methods follow the standard multiple instance learning (MIL) paradigm and have achieved promising performance. However, the lack of deterministic information leads to part domination and missing instances. To address these issues, this paper focuses on identifying and fully exploiting the deterministic information in WSOD. We discover that negative instances (i.e. absolutely wrong instances), ignored in most of the previous studies, normally contain valuable deterministic information. Based on this observation, we here propose a negative deterministic information (NDI) based method for improving WSOD, namely NDI-WSOD. Specifically, our method consists of two stages: NDI collecting and exploiting. In the collecting stage, we design several processes to identify and distill the NDI from negative instances online. In the exploiting stage, we utilize the extracted NDI to construct a novel negative contrastive learning mechanism and a negative guided instance selection strategy for dealing with the issues of part domination and missing instances, respectively. Experimental results on several public benchmarks including VOC 2007, VOC 2012 and MS COCO show that our method achieves satisfactory performance.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0192.pdf"

Against this issue, we propose an adaptive convolutional dictionary network (ACDNet), which leverages both model-based and learning-based methods. Specifically, we explore the prior structures of metal artifacts, e.g., non-local repetitive streaking patterns, and encode them as an explicit weighted convolutional dictionary model. Then, a simple-yet-effective algorithm is carefully designed to solve the model. By unfolding every iterative substep of the proposed algorithm into a network module, we explicitly embed the prior structure into a deep network , i.e., a clear interpretability for the MAR task. Furthermore, our ACDNet can automatically learn the prior for artifact-free CT images via training data and adaptively adjust the representation kernels for each input CT image based on its content. Hence, our method inherits the clear interpretability of model-based methods and maintains the powerful representation ability of learning-based methods.

In this work, we address this problem by integrating LDR-to-HDR imaging knowledge into an UNet architecture, dubbed as Knowledge-inspired UNet (KUNet). The conversion from LDR-to-HDR image is mathematically formulated, and can be conceptually divided into recovering missing details, adjusting imaging parameters and reducing imaging noise. Accordingly, we develop a basic knowledge-inspired block (KIB) including three subnetworks corresponding to the three procedures in this HDR imaging process. The KIB blocks are cascaded in the similar way to the UNet to construct HDR image with rich global information. In addition, we also propose a knowledge inspired jump-connect structure to fit a dynamic range gap between HDR and LDR images.

To this end, we propose a novel Bi-directional Correspondence Mapping Network (BiCo-Net) to first generate point clouds guided by a typical pose regression, which can thus incorporate pose-sensitive information to optimize generation of local coordinates and their normal vectors. As pose predictions via geometric computation only rely on one single pair of local oriented points, our BiCo-Net can achieve robustness against sparse and occluded point clouds. An ensemble of redundant pose predictions from locally matching and direct pose regression further refines final pose output against noisy observations.

We find that existing DIDs are vulnerable to the adversarial noise generated by OBSATK. Secondly, to robustify DIDs, we pro- pose an adversarial training strategy, hybrid adversarial training (HAT), that jointly trains DIDs with adversarial and non-adversarial noisy data to ensure that the reconstruction quality is high and the denoisers around non-adversarial data are locally smooth. The resultant DIDs can effectively remove various types of synthetic and adversarial noise. We also uncover that the robustness of DIDs benefits their generalization capability on unseen real-world noise. Indeed, HAT-trained DIDs can recover high-quality clean images from real-world noise even without training on real noisy data.

Specifically, we combine seen classes to hallucinate new classes which play as placeholders of the unseen classes in the visual and semantic space. Placed between seen classes, the placeholders encourage prototypes of seen classes to be highly dispersed. And more space is spared for the insertion of well-separated unseen ones.

At the coarse level, we first model the coarse human body poses and shapes via an unclothed 3D deformable vertex model as guidance. At the fine level, we present a multi-view sampling network to capture subtle geometric deformations and image detailed appearances, such as clothing and hair, from multiple input views. Considering the sparsity of the two level features, we diffuse them into feature volumes in the canonical space to construct neural radiance fields. Then, we present a signed distance function (SDF) regression network to construct body surfaces from the diffused features.

PTQ requires a small set of calibration data and is easier for deployment, but results in lower accuracy than Quantization-Aware Training( QAT). Power-of-Two quantization can convert the multiplication introduced by quantization and dequantization to bit-shift that is adopted by many efficient accelerators. However, the Power-of-Two scale has fewer candidate values, which leads to more rounding or clipping errors. We propose a novel Power-of-Two PTQ framework, dubbed RAPQ, which dynamically adjusts the Power-of-Two scales of the whole network instead of statically determining them layer by layer. It can theoretically trade off the rounding error and clipping error of the whole network. Meanwhile, the reconstruction method in RAPQ is based on the BN information of every unit. Extensive experiments on ImageNet prove the excellent performance of our proposed method. Without bells and whistles, RAPQ can reach accuracy of 65% and 48% on ResNet-18 and MobileNetV2 respectively with  weight INT2 activation INT4.

Its testing metrics, e.g., mean-average precision, count on a sorted candidate list ordered by pair-wise code similarity. However, scarcely does one train a deep hashing model with the sorted results end-to-end because of the non-differentiable nature of the sorting operation. This inconsistency in the objectives of training and test may lead to sub-optimal performance since the training loss often fails to reflect the actual retrieval metric. In this paper, we tackle this problem by introducing Naturally-Sorted Hashing (NSH). We sort the Hamming distances of samples' hash codes and accordingly gather their latent representations for self-supervised training. Thanks to the recent advances in differentiable sorting approximations, the hash head receives gradients from the sorter so that the hash encoder can be optimized along with the training procedure. Additionally, we describe a novel Sorted Noise-Contrastive Estimation (SortedNCE) loss that selectively picks positive and negative samples for contrastive learning, which allows NSH to mine data semantic relations during training in an unsupervised manner. Our extensive experiments show the proposed NSH model significantly outperforms the existing unsupervised hashing methods on three benchmarked datasets.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0221.pdf"

The crux of FSS is how to aggregate dense correlations between support and query images for query segmentation while being robust to the large variations in appearance and context. To this end, previous Transformer-based methods explore global consensus either on context similarity or affinity map between support-query pairs. In this work, we effectively integrate the context and affinity information via the proposed novel Context and Affinity Transformer (CATrans) in a hierarchical architecture. Specifically, the Relation-guided Context Transformer (RCT) propagates context information from support to query images conditioned on more informative support features. Based on the observation that a huge feature distinction between support and query pairs brings barriers for context knowledge transfer, the Relation-guided Affinity Transformer (RAT) measures attention-aware affinity as auxiliary information for FSS, in which the self-affinity is responsible for more reliable cross-affinity. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0231.pdf"

Existing state-of-the-art transferable adversarial attacks tend to exploit intrinsic features of objects to generate adversarial examples. This paper proposes the Random Patch Attack (RPA) to significantly improve the transferability of adversarial examples by the patch-wise random transformation that effectively highlights important intrinsic features of objects. Specifically, we introduce random patch transformations to original images to variate model-specific features. Important object-related features are preserved after aggregating the transformed images since they stay consistent in multiple transformations while model-specific elements are neutralized. The obtained essential features steer noises to perturb the object-related regions, generating the adversarial examples of superior transferability across different models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RPA. Compared to the state-of-the-art transferable attacks, our attacks improve the black-box attack success rate by 2.9\% against normally trained models, 4.7\% against defense models, and 4.6\% against vision transformers on average, reaching a maximum of 99.1\%, 93.2\%, and 87.8\%, respectively.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0233.pdf"

In DALB, the Camera Domain Classifier and the feature extractor compete against each other in an adversarial way to encourage the emergence of domain-invariant features. At the same time, the Illuminant Transformation Module performs color space conversion to solve the inconsistent color space problem caused by those domain-invariant features. They collaboratively avoid model degradation of multi-device training caused by the domain discrepancy of feature distribution, which enables our DALCC to benefit from multi-domain data. Besides, to better utilize multi-domain data, we propose the FRM that reweights the feature map to suppress Non-Primary Illuminant regions, which reduces the influence of misleading illuminant information.

It is in the form of probability distribution, has an obvious modal gap with STISR - a pixel-level task; 2) Inaccuracy. it usually contains wrong information, thus will mislead the main task and degrade super-resolution performance. In this paper, we present a novel method C3-STISR that jointly exploits the recognizer's feedback, visual and linguistical information as clues to guide super-resolution. Here, visual clue is from the images of texts predicted by the recognizer, which is informative and more compatible with the STISR task; while linguistical clue is generated by a pre-trained character-level language model, which is able to correct the predicted texts.

However, the existing UAP generator is underdeveloped when images are drawn from different image sources (e.g., with different image resolutions). Towards an authentic universality across image sources, we take a novel view of UAP generation as a customized instance of ``few-shot learning'', which leverages bilevel optimization and learning-to-optimize (L2O) techniques for UAP generation with improved attack success rate (ASR). We begin by considering the popular model agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework to meta-learn a UAP generator. However, we see that the MAML framework does not directly offer the universal attack across image sources, requiring us to integrate it with another meta-learning framework of L2O. The resulting scheme for meta-learning a UAP generator (i) has better performance (50% higher ASR) than baselines such as Projected Gradient Descent, (ii) has better performance (37% faster) than the vanilla L2O and MAML frameworks (when applicable), and (iii) is able to simultaneously handle UAP generation for different victim models and data sources.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0239.pdf"

Driven by the observation that domains are strongly related to styles, we argue that reducing the gap between source and target styles can boost models’ generalizability. To solve the dilemma of having no access to the target domain during training, we introduce Test-time Fourier Style Calibration (TF-Cal) for calibrating the target domain style on the fly during testing. To access styles, we utilize Fourier transformation to decompose features into amplitude (style) features and phase (semantic) features. Furthermore, we present an effective technique to Augment Amplitude Features (AAF) to complement TF-Cal.

In this paper, we analyze the drawbacks of existing attack approaches and propose a novel imperceptible backdoor attack. We treat the trigger pattern as a special kind of noise following a multinomial distribution. A U-net-based network is employed to generate concrete parameters of multinomial distribution for each benign input. This elaborated trigger ensures that our approach is invisible to both humans and statistical detection.

We force the feature representation of malicious input stamped with the trigger to be entangled with the benign one.

Existing head synthesis works mainly focus on low-resolution inputs. Instead, we exploit the powerful generative prior embedded in StyleGAN to achieve high-quality head synthesis and editing. Specifically, we first extract the source image's appearance and driving image's motion to construct 3D face descriptors, which are employed as latent style codes for the generator. Meanwhile, hierarchical representations are extracted from the source and rendered 3D images respectively to provide faithful appearance and shape guidance. Considering the appearance representations need high-resolution flow fields for spatial transform, we propose a coarse-to-fine style-based generator consisting of a series of feature alignment and refinement (FAR) blocks. Each FAR block updates the dense flow fields and refines RGB outputs simultaneously for efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method blends source appearance and target motion more accurately along with more photo-realistic results than previous state-of-the-art approaches.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0244.pdf"

To this end, we develop a novel hierarchical bilevel learning scheme to discover the architecture and loss simultaneously for different Hadamard-based image restoration tasks.   More concretely, we first establish a new Hadamard-inspired neural unit to aggregate domain knowledge into the network design. Then we model a triple-level optimization that consists of the architecture, loss and parameters optimizations to deliver a macro perspective for network learning. Then we introduce a new hierarchical bilevel learning scheme for solving the built triple-level model to progressively generate the desired architecture and loss. We also define an architecture search space consisting of a series of simple operations and an image quality-oriented loss search space.   Extensive experiments on three Hadamard-based image restoration tasks (including low-light image enhancement, single image haze removal and underwater image enhancement) fully verify our superiority against state-of-the-art methods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0245.pdf"

Our GD+Solver hybrid algorithm, called GDSolver, works as follows: given a DNN D as input, GDSolver invokes GD to partially train D until it gets stuck in a local minima, at which point GDSolver invokes an MILP solver to exhaustively search a region of the loss landscape around the weight assignments of D’s final layer parameters with the goal of tunnelling through and escaping the local minima. The process is repeated until desired accuracy is achieved. In our experiments, we find that GDSolver not only scales well to additional data and very large model sizes, but also outperforms all other competing methods in terms of rates of convergence and data efficiency. For regression tasks, GDSolver produced models that, on average, had 31.5% lower MSE in 48% less time, and for classification tasks on MNIST and CIFAR10, GDSolver was able to achieve the highest accuracy over all competing methods, using only 50% of the training data that GD baselines required.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0246.pdf"

In this work, we present a modular algorithm called DPSampler that extends such dynamic-programming techniques to the problem of exact weighted sampling. DPSampler operates in three phases. First, an execution plan in the form of a project-join tree is computed using tree decompositions. Second, the plan is used to compile the input formula into a succinct tree-of-ADDs representation. Third, this tree is traversed to generate a random sample. This decoupling of planning, compilation and sampling phases enables usage of specialized libraries for each purpose in a black-box fashion. Further, our novel ADD-sampling algorithm avoids the need for expensive dynamic memory allocation required in previous work. Extensive experiments over diverse sets of benchmarks show DPSampler is more scalable and versatile than existing approaches.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0250.pdf"

Security negligence and human errors often lead to misconfiguring IAM policies which may open a backdoor for attackers. To address these challenges, first, we develop a novel framework that encodes generating optimal IAM policies using constraint programming (CP). We identify reducing dormant permissions of cloud users as an optimality criterion, which intuitively implies minimizing unnecessary datastore access permissions. Second, to make IAM policies interpretable, we use graph representation learning applied to historical access patterns of users to augment our CP model with similarity constraints: similar users should be grouped together and share common IAM policies.

As many hand-crafted branching heuristics have been proposed in the literature, a key issue is to identify, from a pool of candidate heuristics, which one is the best for solving a given constraint satisfaction task.  Based on the observation that modern constraint solvers are using restart sequences, the best heuristic identification problem can be cast in the context of multi-armed bandits as a non-stochastic best arm identification problem. Namely, during each run of some given restart sequence, the bandit algorithm selects a branching heuristic and receives a reward for this heuristic before proceeding to the next run. The goal is to identify the best heuristic using few runs, and without any stochastic assumption about the constraint solver. In this study, we propose an adaptive variant of Successive Halving that exploits Luby's universal restart sequence. We analyze the convergence of this bandit algorithm in the non-stochastic setting, and we demonstrate its empirical effectiveness on various constraint satisfaction benchmarks.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0258.pdf"

The proposed algorithm can converge much faster and achieve significant speedup by simultaneously enjoying the sparsity of the model and data. Moreover, by sending the gradients on the active set only, communication costs are dramatically reduced.

However, the input hypergraph structure inevitably contains noise, task-irrelevant information, or false-negative connections.Treating the input hypergraph structure as ground-truth information unavoidably leads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Hypergraph Structure Learning (HSL) framework, which optimizes the hypergraph structure and the HGNNs simultaneously in an end-to-end way. HSL learns an informative and concise hypergraph structure that is optimized for downstream tasks. To efficiently learn the hypergraph structure, HSL adopts a two-stage sampling process: hyperedge sampling for pruning redundant hyperedges and incident node sampling for pruning irrelevant incident nodes and discovering potential implicit connections. The consistency between the optimized structure and the original structure is maintained by the intra-hyperedge contrastive learning module.The sampling processes are jointly optimized with HGNNs towards the objective of the downstream tasks.

Meanwhile, graph neural networks (GNNs) is emerging as a powerful tool for modeling graph data. A natural and fundamental question that arises here is: can abnormality be detected by graph neural networks?In this paper, we aim to answer this question, which is nontrivial. As many existing works have explored, graph neural networks can be seen as filters for graph signals, with the favor of low frequency in graphs. In other words, GNN will smooth the signals of adjacent nodes. However, abnormality in a graph intuitively has the characteristic that it tends to be dissimilar to its neighbors, which are mostly normal samples. It thereby conflicts with the general assumption with traditional GNNs. To solve this, we propose a novel Adaptive Multi-frequency Graph Neural Network (AMNet), aiming to capture both low-frequency and high-frequency signals, and adaptively combine signals of different frequencies.

To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose VFGNN, a federated GNN learning paradigm for privacy-preserving node classification task under data vertically partitioned setting, which can be generalized to existing GNN models. Specifically, we split the computation graph into two parts. We leave the private data (i.e., features, edges, and labels) related computations on data holders, and delegate the rest of computations to a semi-honest server.

Second, different variables’ time series often havedistinct temporal dynamics, which existing studies fail to capture, as they use the same model parameter space, e.g., projection matrices, for all variables’ time series, thus falling short in accuracy. To ensure high efficiency and accuracy, we propose Triformer, a triangular, variable-specific attention. (i) Linear complexity: we introduce a novel patch attention with linear complexity. When stacking multiple layers of the patch attentions, a triangular structure is proposed such that thelayer sizes shrink exponentially, thus maintaining linear complexity.

Furthermore, the reconstruction error is highly influenced by the `hardness' of a given sample, which leads to false negative and false positive errors.

Meanwhile, we propose a star-style contrastive learning task to capture the embedding commonality between target and auxiliary behaviors, so as to alleviate the sparsity of supervision signal, reduce the redundancy among auxiliary behavior, and extract the most critical information. Finally, we jointly optimize the above two tasks.

However, adapting the pretrained features would be confronted with the risk of pattern collapse when finetuning on one-class training data. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection framework called constrained adaptive projection with pretrained features (CAP). Combined with pretrained features, a simple linear projection head applied on a specific input and its k most similar pretrained normal representations is designed for feature adaptation, and a reformed self-attention is leveraged to mine the inner-relationship among one-class semantic features. A loss function is proposed to avoid potential pattern collapse. Concretely, it considers the similarity between a specific data and its corresponding adaptive normal representation, and incorporates a constraint term slightly aligning pretrained and adaptive spaces.

We argue that different dimensions of vector-based embedding are naturally entangled with each other. To realize a), we expect to decompose the D dimensional embedding space into D different semantic subspaces, where each subspace is associated with a  matrix representation. Unfortunately, introducing a matrix-based representation requires far more complex parametric space than its vector-based counterparts. Thanks to the algebraic property of quaternions, we are able to find a more efficient way to represent a matrix with quaternions. For b), inspired by the classic chordal Grassmannian distance, a new distance function is defined to measure the distance between different quaternions/matrices, on top of which we construct a generic OE loss function.

This paper believes that the main cause lies in the limited diversity along the message passing pipeline. Inspired by this, we propose a Sparse-Motif Ensemble Graph Convolutional Network (SMEGCN). We argue that merely employing the original graph Laplacian as the spectrum of the graph cannot capture the diversified local structure of complex graphs. Hence, to improve the diversity of the graph spectrum, we introduce local topological structures of complex graphs into GCN by employing the so-called graph motifs or the small network subgraphs. Moreover, we find that the motif connections are much denser than the edge connections, which might converge to an all-one matrix within a few times of message-passing. To fix this, we first propose the notion of sparse motif to avoid spurious motif connections. Subsequently, we propose a hierarchical motif aggregation mechanism to integrate the graph spectral information from a series of different sparse-motif message passing paths. Finally, we conduct a series of theoretical and experimental analyses to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0291.pdf"

In addition, existing unsupervised graph similarity learning methods are mainly clustering-based, which ignores the valuable information embodied in graph pairs. To this end, we propose a contrastive graph matching network (CGMN) for self-supervised graph similarity learning in order to calculate the similarity between any two input graph objects. Specifically, we generate two augmented views for each graph in a pair respectively. Then, we employ two strategies, namely cross-view interaction and cross-graph interaction, for effective node representation learning. The former is resorted to strengthen the consistency of node representations in two views. The latter is utilized to identify node differences between different graphs.

Several methods have attempted to address this heterophily problem, but they do not change the fundamental aggregation mechanism of GCNs because they rely on summation operators to aggregate information from neighboring nodes, which is implicitly subject to the homophily assumption. Here, we introduce a novel aggregation mechanism and develop a RAndom Walk Aggregation-based Graph Neural Network (called RAW-GNN) method. The proposed approach integrates the random walk strategy with graph neural networks. The new method utilizes breadth-first random walk search to capture homophily information and depth-first search to collect heterophily information.

With privacy concerns, accessing the decentralized data is limited to either individual clients or different silos. To tackle these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving framework to analyze the GW discrepancy of node embedding learned locally from graph neural networks in a federated flavor, and then explicitly place local differential privacy (LDP) based on Multi-bit Encoder to protect sensitive information. Our experiments show that, with strong privacy protection guaranteed by ε-LDP algorithm, the proposed framework not only preserves privacy in graph learning, but also presents a noised structural metric under GW distance, resulting in comparable and even better performance in classification and clustering tasks.

In the extrapolation setting of TKG reasoning, since facts happening in the future are entirely unknowable, insight into history is the key to predicting future facts. However, it is still a great challenge for existing models as they hardly learn the characteristics of historical events adequately. From the perspective of historical development laws, comprehensively considering the sequential, repetitive, and cyclical patterns of historical facts is conducive to predicting future facts. To this end, we propose a novel representation learning model for TKG reasoning, namely TiRGN, a time-guided recurrent graph network with local-global historical patterns. Specifically, TiRGN uses a local recurrent graph encoder network to model the historical dependency of events at adjacent timestamps and uses the global history encoder network to collect repeated historical facts. After the trade-off between the two encoders, the final inference is performed by a decoder with periodicity. We use six benchmark datasets to evaluate the proposed method. The experimental results show that TiRGN outperforms the state-of-the-art TKG reasoning methods in most cases.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0299.pdf"

To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Continuous Time based Neural Cognitive Modeling(CT-NCM) approach to integrate the dynamism and continuity of knowledge forgetting into students' learning process modeling in a realistic manner. To be specific, we first adapt the neural Hawkes process with a specially-designed learning event encoding method to model the relationship between knowledge learning and forgetting with continuous time. Then, we propose a learning function with extendable settings to jointly model the change of different knowledge states and their interactions with the exercises at each moment. In this way, CT-NCM can simultaneously predict the future knowledge state and exercise performance of students. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets with various benchmark methods.

In real-world scenarios, data accumulated at the client-side varies in distribution over time. As a consequence, the global model tends to forget the knowledge obtained from previous tasks while learning new tasks, showing signs of ""catastrophic forgetting"". Previous studies in centralized learning use techniques such as data replay and parameter regularization to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Unfortunately, these techniques cannot adequately solve the non-trivial problem in FL. We propose Continual Federated Learning with Distillation (CFeD) to address catastrophic forgetting under FL. CFeD performs knowledge distillation on both the clients and the server, with each party independently having an unlabeled surrogate dataset, to mitigate forgetting. Moreover, CFeD assigns different learning objectives, namely learning the new task and reviewing old tasks, to different clients, aiming to improve the learning ability of the model.

In fact, most of the previous IPS-based methods require some amount of missing-completely-at-random (MCAR) data to accurately estimate the propensity. This leads to a critical self-contradiction; IPS is ineffective without MCAR data, even though it originally aims to learn recommenders from only missing-not-at-random feedback.

Our theory and algorithm do not require a propensity estimation procedure, thereby leading to a well-performing rating predictor without the true propensity information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is superior to a range of existing methods both in rating prediction and ranking metrics in practical settings without MCAR data.

This problem has motivated efforts in predicting the most plausible missing facts to complete a given KG, i.e., knowledge graph completion (KGC). However, existing KGC methods suffer from two main issues, 1) the false negative issue, i.e., the sampled negative training instances may include potential true facts; and 2) the data sparsity issue, i.e., true facts account for only a tiny part of all possible facts. To this end, we propose positive-unlabeled learning with adversarial data augmentation (PUDA) for KGC. In particular, PUDA tailors positive-unlabeled risk estimator for the KGC task to deal with the false negative issue. Furthermore, to address the data sparsity issue, PUDA achieves a data augmentation strategy by unifying adversarial training and positive-unlabeled learning under the positive-unlabeled minimax game.

In this paper, a small number of anomalies are assumed to be available at the training stage, but they are assumed to be collected only from several anomaly types, leaving the majority of anomaly types not represented in the collected anomaly dataset at all. To effectively leverage this kind of incomplete anomalous knowledge represented by the collected anomalies, we propose to learn a probability distribution that can not only model the normal samples, but also guarantee to assign low density values for the collected anomalies. To this end, an anomaly-aware generative adversarial network (GAN) is developed, which, in addition to modeling the normal samples as most GANs do, is able to explicitly avoid assigning probabilities for collected anomalous samples. Moreover, to facilitate the computation of anomaly detection criteria like reconstruction error, the proposed anomaly-aware GAN is designed to be bidirectional, attaching an encoder for the generator.  Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method is able to effectively make use of the incomplete anomalous information, leading to significant performance gains comparing to existing methods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0313.pdf"

However, MEI has several drawbacks, some of which carried from its subsumed tensor-decomposition-based models.

However, existing methods generally ignore task correlations among meta-training tasks while treating them independently. Nevertheless, such task correlations can advance the model generalization to the target task for better classification performance. On the other hand, it remains non-trivial to utilize task correlations due to the complex components in a large number of meta-training tasks.

However, existing collaborative learning methods require fully-labeled data for training, which is inconvenient or sometimes infeasible to obtain due to the high labeling cost and the requirement of expertise. The lack of labels makes collaborative learning impractical in many realistic settings. Self-supervised learning can address this challenge by learning from unlabeled data. Contrastive learning (CL), a self-supervised learning approach, can effectively learn visual representations from unlabeled image data. However, the distributed data collected on clients are usually not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) among clients, and each client may only have few classes of data, which degrades the performance of CL and learned representations. To tackle this problem, we propose a collaborative contrastive learning framework consisting of two approaches: feature fusion and neighborhood matching, by which a unified feature space among clients is learned for better data representations. Feature fusion provides remote features as accurate contrastive information to each client for better local learning. Neighborhood matching further aligns each client’s local features to the remote features such that well-clustered features among clients can be learned.

However, all these works only consider the enclosing part of subgraph without complete neighboring relations, which leads to the issue that partial neighboring relations are neglected, and sparse subgraphs are hard to be handled. To address that, we propose Subgraph Neighboring Relations Infomax, SNRI, which sufficiently exploits complete neighboring relations from two aspects: neighboring relational feature for node feature and neighboring relational path for sparse subgraph. To further model neighboring relations in a global way, we innovatively apply mutual information (MI) maximization for knowledge graph. Experiments show that SNRI outperforms existing state-of-art methods by a large margin on inductive link prediction task, and verify the effectiveness of exploring complete neighboring relations in a global way to characterize node features and reason on sparse subgraphs.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0325.pdf"

Existing methods cannot support such complex scenarios. To fill the gap, this paper proposes a Generalized Online Canonical Polyadic (CP) Tensor factorization and completion framework (named GOCPT) for this general setting, where we maintain the CP structure of such dynamic tensors during the evolution. We show that existing online tensor factorization and completion setups can be unified under the GOCPT framework. Furthermore, we propose a variant, named GOCPTE, to deal with cases where historical tensor elements are unavailable (e.g., privacy protection), which achieves similar fitness as GOCPT but with much less computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that our GOCPT can improve fitness by up to 2.8% on the JHU Covid data and 9.2% on a proprietary patient claim dataset over baselines.

We devise a new approach named as Hardness-Aware Debiased Contrastive Collaborative Filtering (HDCCF) to resolve the dilemma.

To circumvent false negatives, we develop a principled approach to improve the reliability of negative instances and prove that the objective is an unbiased estimation of sampling from the true negative distribution.

Some recent works attempts to learn the intrinsic or implicit graph structure directly, while lacking a way to combine explicit prior structure with implicit structure together. In this paper, we propose Regularized Graph Structure Learning (RGSL) model to incorporate both explicit prior structure and implicit structure together, and learn the forecasting deep networks along with the graph structure.

Second, we propose a Laplacian Matrix Mixed-up Module (LM3) to fuse the explicit graph and implicit graph together. We conduct experiments on three real-word datasets.

In this paper, we investigate how to leverage an unlabelled code corpus to train a model for library-oriented code generation. Since it is a common practice for programmers to reuse third-party libraries, in which case the text-code paired data are harder to obtain due to the huge number of libraries. We observe that library-oriented code snippets are more likely to share similar code sketches. Hence, we present CERT with two steps: a sketcher generates the sketch, then a generator fills the details in the sketch. Both the sketcher and generator are continually pre-trained upon a base model using unlabelled data.

To address this problem, this paper provides a dynamic graph representation learning framework for OD demands prediction. In particular, a hierarchical memory updater is first proposed to maintain a time-aware representation for each node, and the representations are updated according to the most recently observed OD trips in continuous-time and multiple discrete-time ways. Second, a spatiotemporal propagation mechanism is provided to aggregate representations of neighbor nodes along a random spatiotemporal route which treats origin and destination as two different semantic entities.

Specifically, GCL4SR employs a Weighted Item Transition Graph (WITG), built based on interaction sequences of all users, to provide global context information for each interaction and weaken the noise information in the sequence data. Moreover, GCL4SR uses subgraphs of WITG to augment the representation of each interaction sequence. Two auxiliary learning objectives have also been proposed to maximize the consistency between augmented representations induced by the same interaction sequence on WITG, and minimize the difference between the representations augmented by the global context on WITG and the local representation of the original sequence.

Recent efforts start to explicitly model the feature interactions with  graph, where each feature is treated as an individual node. However, the existing graph construction methods either heuristically formulate a fixed feature-interaction graph based on specific domain knowledge, or simply apply attention function to compute the pairwise feature similarities for each sample. While the fixed graph may be sub-optimal to downstream tasks, the sample-wise graph construction is time-consuming during model training and inference. To tackle these issues, we propose a framework named Table2Graph to transform the feature interaction modeling to learning a unified graph. Represented as a probability adjacency matrix, the unified graph learns to model the key feature interactions shared by the diverse samples in the tabular data. To well optimize the unified graph, we employ the reinforcement learning policy to capture the key feature interactions stably. A sparsity constraint is also proposed to regularize the learned graph from being overly-sparse/smooth.

In this paper, we decouple the two issues via robust stochastic model aggregation, in the sense that  our proposed DP mechanisms and the defense against Byzantine attacks have separated influence on the learning performance. Leveraging robust stochastic model aggregation, at each iteration, each worker calculates the difference between the local model and the global one, followed by sending the element-wise signs to the master node, which enables robustness to Byzantine attacks. Further, we design two DP mechanisms to perturb the uploaded signs for the purpose of privacy preservation, and prove that they are (epsilon,0)-DP by exploiting the properties of noise distributions. With the tools of Moreau envelop and proximal point projection, we establish the convergence of the proposed algorithm when the cost function is nonconvex.

In this work, we propose SpikingGCN, an end-to-end framework that aims to integrate the embedding of GCNs with the biofidelity characteristics of SNNs. The original graph data are encoded into spike trains based on the incorporation of graph convolution. We further model biological information processingby utilizing a fully connected layer combined with neuron nodes. In a wide range of scenarios (e.g., citation networks, image graph classification, and recommender systems), our experimental results show that the proposed method could gain competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

To tackle this problem, we strengthen the graph with three types of additional graph views, in which each node is directly linked to a set of nodes with the highest similarity in terms of node features, neighborhood features or local structures. Not restricted by connectivity in the original graph, the generated views provide new and complementary perspectives from which to look at the relationship between nodes. Inspired by the recent success of contrastive learning approaches, we propose a self-supervised method that aims to learn node representations by maximizing the agreement between representations across generated views and the original graph, without the requirement of any label information.

The proposed tier-3 transposes time- and space-domain of spike patterns from the SNN; and feeds the transposed pattern-matrices into an artificial neural network (ANN, Transformer specifically) known as tier-4, where a special spanning topology is proposed to match the two-dimensional input form. In this manner, cognition such as classification is conducted with high accuracy.

In this paper, we propose a multi-level firing (MLF) method based on the existing spatio-temporal back propagation (STBP) method, and spiking dormant-suppressed residual network (spiking DS-ResNet). MLF enables more efficient gradient propagation and the incremental expression ability of the neurons. Spiking DS-ResNet can efficiently perform identity mapping of discrete spikes, as well as provide a more suitable connection for gradient propagation in deep SNNs.

In this work, we propose an approach that trains a classification model to complement the capabilities of multiple human experts. By jointly training the classifier together with an allocation system, the classifier learns to accurately predict those instances that are difficult for the human experts, while the allocation system learns to pass each instance to the most suitable team member—either the classifier or one of the human experts. We evaluate our proposed approach in multiple experiments on public datasets with “synthetic” experts and a real-world medical dataset annotated by multiple radiologists.

To speed up the inference process and obtain higher accuracy, we theoretically analyze the errors in the conversion process from three perspectives: the differences between IF and ReLU, time dimension, and pooling operation. We propose a neuron model for releasing burst spikes, a cheap but highly efficient method to solve residual information. In addition, Lateral Inhibition Pooling (LIPooling) is proposed to solve the inaccuracy problem caused by MaxPooling in the conversion process. Experimental results on CIFAR and ImageNet demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and accurate.

As an alternative, SNN can be converted from a pre-trained artificial neural network (ANN) to bypass the difficulty in SNNs learning. However, the existing ANN-to-SNN methods neglect the inconsistency of information transmission between synchronous ANNs and asynchronous SNNs. In this work, we first analyze how the asynchronous spikes in SNNs may cause conversion errors between ANN and SNN. To address this problem, we propose a signed neuron with memory function, which enables almost no accuracy loss during the conversion process, and maintains the properties of asynchronous transmission in the converted SNNs.

However, in practice the labels often contain noise, and incorporating too many noisy negative samples into model training may be suboptimal. In this paper, we study how many negative samples are optimal for InfoNCE in different scenarios via a semi-quantitative theoretical framework. More specifically, we first propose a probabilistic model to analyze the influence of the negative sampling ratio K on training sample informativeness. Then, we design a training effectiveness function to measure the overall influence of training samples based on their informativeness. We estimate the optimal negative sampling ratio using the K value that maximizes the training effectiveness function.

These generalize strong-cyclic policies by taking advantage of stochasticity even if the goal cannot be reached with probability 1. We compare such policies with optimal policies, i.e., policies that maximize the probability that the goal is achieved, and show that optimal policies are best-effort, but that the converse is false in general. With this framework at hand, we revisit the foundational problem of what it means to plan in nondeterministic domains when the nondeterminism has a stochastic nature. We show that one can view a nondeterministic planning domain as a representation of infinitely many stochastic domains with the same support but different probabilities, and that for temporally extended goals expressed in LTL/LTLf a finite-state best-effort policy in one of these domains is best-effort in each of the domains.

However, for certain types of problems, the well-known ASP grounding bottleneck still causes severe problems. This becomes virulent when grounding of rules, where the variables have to be replaced by constants, leads to a ground pro- gram that is too huge to be processed by the ASP solver. In this work, we tackle this problem by a novel method that decouples non-ground atoms in rules in order to delegate the evaluation of rule bodies to the solving process. Our procedure translates a non-ground normal program into a ground disjunctive program that is exponential only in the maximum predicate arity, and thus polynomial if this arity is assumed to be bounded by a constant. We demonstrate the feasibility of this new method experimentally by comparing it to standard ASP technology in terms of grounding size, grounding time and total runtime.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0353.pdf"

Nevertheless, its high expressiveness comes useful in a number of use cases, such as model-checking of data-aware processes and data-aware planning. Despite the general undecidability of these problems, being able to solve satisfiable instances is a compromise worth studying. After motivating and describing such use cases, we provide a sound and complete semi-decision procedure for LTLfMT based on the SMT encoding of a one-pass tree-shaped tableau system. The algorithm is implemented in the BLACK satisfiability checking tool, and an experimental evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach on novel benchmarks.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0366.pdf"

Compared to other state-of-the-art approaches to learning ASP, FastLAS is more scalable, as rather than computing the hypothesis space in full, it computes a much smaller subset relative to a given set of examples that is nonetheless guaranteed to contain an optimal solution to the task (called an OPT-sufficient subset). On the other hand, like many other Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) systems, FastLAS is designed to be run on a fixed learning task meaning that if new examples are discovered after learning, the whole process must be run again.In many real applications, data arrives in a stream. Rerunning an ILP system from scratch each time new examples arrive is inefficient. In this paper we address this problem by presenting IncrementalLAS, a system that uses a new technique, called hypothesis space expansion, to enable a FastLAS-like OPT-sufficient subset to be expanded each time new examples are discovered. We prove that this preserves FastLAS's guarantee of finding an optimal solution to the full task (including the new examples), while removing the need to repeat previous computations.

Tian and Pearl provided bounds on this and other probabilities of causation using a combination of experimental and observational data. Those bounds, though tight, can be narrowed significantly  when structural information is available in the form of a causal model. This added information may provide the power to solve central problems, such as explainable AI, legal responsibility, and personalized medicine, all of which demand counterfactual logic.

Although they achieved competitive performance on small KGs, how to efficiently and effectively utilize graph context for large KGs remains an open problem. To this end, we propose the Relation-based Embedding Propagation (REP) method. It is a post-processing technique to adapt pre-trained KG embeddings with graph context. As relations in KGs are directional, we model the incoming head context and the outgoing tail context separately. Accordingly, we design relational context functions with no external parameters. Besides, we use averaging to aggregate context information, making REP more computation-efficient. We theoretically prove that such designs can avoid information distortion during propagation. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that REP has significant scalability while improving or maintaining prediction quality. Particularly, it averagely brings about 10% relative improvement to triplet-based embedding methods on OGBL-WikiKG2 and takes 5%-83% time to achieve comparable results as the state-of-the-art GC-OTE.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0382.pdf"

We propose a method called prediction filtering, which instead of extracting pseudo-labels, just uses the classifier as a classifier: it ignores any segmentation predictions from classes which the classifier is confident are not present. Adding this simple post-processing method to baselines gives results competitive with or better than prior SWSSS algorithms.

However, existing GCL methods are generally transferred from other fields like CV or NLP, whose underlying working mechanism remains underexplored. In this work, we first deeply probe the working mechanism of GCL in SSNC, and find that the promotion brought by GCL is severely unevenly distributed: the improvement mainly comes from subgraphs with less annotated information, which is fundamentally different from contrastive learning in other fields. However, existing GCL methods generally ignore this uneven distribution of annotated information and apply GCL evenly to the whole graph. To remedy this issue and further improve GCL in SSNC, we propose the Topology InFormation gain-Aware Graph Contrastive Learning (TIFA-GCL) framework that considers the annotated information distribution across graph in GCL.

Unlike conventional digital cameras, the spiking camera continuously captures photons and outputs asynchronous binary spikes with various inter-spike intervals to record dynamic scenes. However, how to reconstruct dynamic scenes from asynchronous spike streams remains challenging. In this work, we propose a novel pretext task to build a self-supervised reconstruction framework for spiking cameras. Specifically, we utilize the blind-spot network commonly used in self-supervised denoising tasks as our backbone, and perform self-supervised learning by constructing proper pseudo-labels. In addition, in view of the poor scalability and insufficient information utilization of the blind-spot network, we present a mutual learning framework to improve the overall performance of the network through mutual distillation between a non-blind-spot network and a blind-spot network. This also enables the network to bypass constraints of the blind-spot network, allowing state-of-the-art modules to be used to further improve performance. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods evidently outperform previous unsupervised spiking camera reconstruction methods and achieve desirable results compared with supervised methods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0396.pdf"

On the contrary, human and animal brains are much less vulnerable. In contrast to the one-shot inference performed by most deep neural networks, the brain often solves decision-making with an evidence accumulation mechanism that may trade time for accuracy when facing noisy inputs. The mechanism is well described by the Drift-Diffusion Model (DDM). In the DDM, decision-making is modeled as a process in which noisy evidence is accumulated toward a threshold. Drawing inspiration from the DDM, we propose the Dropout-based Drift-Diffusion Model (DDDM) that combines test-phase dropout and the DDM for improving the robustness for arbitrary neural networks. The dropouts create temporally uncorrelated noises in the network that counter perturbations, while the evidence accumulation mechanism guarantees a reasonable decision accuracy. Neural networks enhanced with the DDDM tested in image, speech, and text classification tasks all significantly outperform their native counterparts, demonstrating the DDDM as a task-agnostic defense against adversarial attacks.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0397.pdf"

Suppose we propose to extract embedding from the embedding network. BE maximizes the extraction of general representation and prevents over-fitting information. For this purpose, we introduce the topological relation for global reconstruction, avoiding excessive memorizing. MS maximizes the relevance between the reconstructed embedding and the target class space. In this respect, increasing the number of shots is a pivotal but intractable strategy. As a creative method, we derive the bound of information-theory-based loss function and implicitly achieve infinite shots with negligible cost. A substantial experimental analysis is carried out to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the baseline, our method improves by up to 10%+.

Most existing FL algorithms require models of identical architecture to be deployed across the clients and server, making it infeasible to train large models due to clients' limited system resources. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble knowledge transfer method named Fed-ET in which small models (different in architecture) are trained on clients, and used to train a larger model at the server. Unlike in conventional ensemble learning, in FL the ensemble can be trained on clients' highly heterogeneous data. Cognizant of this property, Fed-ET uses a weighted consensus distillation scheme with diversity regularization that efficiently extracts reliable consensus from the ensemble while improving generalization by exploiting the diversity within the ensemble. We show the generalization bound for the ensemble of weighted models trained on heterogeneous datasets that supports the intuition of Fed-ET. Our experiments on image and language tasks show that Fed-ET significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art FL algorithms with fewer communicated parameters, and is also robust against high data-heterogeneity.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0399.pdf"

However, those methods usually focus on artificial scenarios where examples share almost no similarity between subsequent portions of data - an assumption not realistic in the real-life applications of continual learning. In this work, we identify this limitation and posit the goal of generative continual learning as a knowledge accumulation task. We solve it by continuously aligning latent representations of new data that we call bands in additional latent space where examples are encoded independently of their source task. In addition, we introduce a method for controlled forgetting of past data that simplifies this process. On top of the standard continual learning benchmarks, we propose a novel challenging knowledge consolidation scenario and show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art by up to twofold across all experiments and additional real-life evaluation.

However, every forward evaluation of a NODE requires numerical integration of the neural network used to capture the system dynamics, making their training prohibitively expensive. Existing works rely on off-the-shelf adaptive step-size numerical integration schemes, which often require an excessive number of evaluations of the underlying dynamics network to obtain sufficient accuracy for training. By contrast, we accelerate the evaluation and the training of NODEs by proposing a data-driven approach to their numerical integration. The proposed Taylor-Lagrange NODEs (TL-NODEs) use a fixed-order Taylor expansion for numerical integration, while also learning to estimate the expansion's approximation error. As a result, the proposed approach achieves the same accuracy as adaptive step-size schemes while employing only low-order Taylor expansions, thus greatly reducing the computational cost necessary to integrate the NODE. A suite of numerical experiments, including modeling dynamical systems, image classification, and density estimation, demonstrate that TL-NODEs can be trained more than an order of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art approaches, without any loss in performance.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0405.pdf"

Our formulation mitigates the severe task misalignment between instance discrimination pretext tasks and downstream image reconstruction tasks, present in existing CL frameworks.

OUDA tasks are challenging for prior UDA methods since online training suffers from catastrophic forgetting which leads to poor generalization. Intuitively, a good memory is a crucial factor in the success of OUDA. We formalize this intuition theoretically with a generalization bound where the OUDA target error can be bounded by the source error, the domain discrepancy distance, and a novel metric on forgetting in continuous online learning. Our theory illustrates the tradeoffs inherent in learning and remembering representations for OUDA. To minimize the proposed forgetting metric, we propose a novel source feature distillation (SFD) method which utilizes the source-only model as a teacher to guide the online training. In the experiment, we modify three UDA algorithms, i.e., DANN, CDAN, and MCC, and evaluate their performance on OUDA tasks with real-world datasets. By applying SFD, the performance of all baselines is significantly improved.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0410.pdf"

However, the classification mechanism of existing deep learning models seems to contrast to humans' recognition mechanism. With only a glance at an image of the object even unknown type, humans can quickly and precisely find other same category objects from massive images, which benefits from daily recognition of various objects. In this paper, we attempt to build a generalizable framework that emulates the humans' recognition mechanism in the image classification task, hoping to improve the classification performance on unseen categories with the support of annotations of other categories. Specifically, we investigate a new task termed Comparison Knowledge Translation (CKT). Given a set of fully labeled categories, CKT aims to translate the comparison knowledge learned from the labeled categories to a set of novel categories. To this end, we put forward a Comparison Classification Translation Network (CCT-Net), which comprises a comparison classifier and a matching discriminator. The comparison classifier is devised to classify whether two images belong to the same category or not, while the matching discriminator works together in an adversarial manner to ensure whether classified results match the truth. Exhaustive experiments show that CCT-Net achieves surprising generalization ability on unseen categories and SOTA performance on target categories.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0411.pdf"

Under a new generalised probabilistic teaching, not only do these non-cheating constraints look too narrow but we also show that the most relevant machine teaching models are particular cases of this framework: the consistency graph between concepts and elements simply becomes a joint probability distribution. We show a simple procedure that builds the witness joint distribution from the ground joint distribution. We prove a chain of relations, also with a theoretical lower bound, on the teaching dimension of the old and new models. Overall, this new setting is more general than the traditional machine teaching models, yet at the same time more intuitively capturing a less abrupt notion of non-cheating teaching.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0412.pdf"

As a result, the adaptive data augmentation outputs multi-view information, which is fed into two GCNs to generate multi-view embedding features. Two kinds of contrastive losses are further designed on multi-view embedding features to explore the complementary information among the topology and feature graphs. Additionally, adaptive data augmentation and contrastive learning are embedded in a unified framework to form an end-to-end model.

Therefore, we motivate our method to generate augmented graph with a learnable graph augmenter, called MEta Graph Augmentation (MEGA). We then clarify that a ""good"" graph augmentation must have uniformity at the instance-level and informativeness at the feature-level.

These interpretable matrices are deemed as trainable tensors in neural networks (NNs). The NNs are devised according to the differentiable semantics of LPs. Specifically, we first adopt a novel propositionalization method that transfers facts to NN-readable vector pairs representing interpretation pairs. We replace the immediate consequence operator with NN constraint functions consisting of algebraic operations and a sigmoid-like activation function. We map the symbolic forward-chained format of LPs into NN constraint functions consisting of operations between subsymbolic vector representations of atoms. By applying gradient descent, the trained well parameters of NNs can be decoded into precise symbolic LPs in forward-chained logic format.

Our key results illustrate that the adversary's budget (that is, the number of bits it can perturb on each input) is a fundamental quantity in determining the sample complexity of robust learning. Our first main result is a sample-complexity lower bound: the class of monotone conjunctions (essentially the simplest non-trivial hypothesis class on the Boolean hypercube) and any superclass  has sample complexity at least exponential in the adversary's budget. Our second main result is a corresponding upper bound: for every fixed k the class of k-decision lists has polynomial sample complexity against a log(n)-bounded adversary.

We argue that this is a fallacy for many modern deep network architectures. Consequently, MIAs will miserably fail since overconfidence leads to high false-positive rates not only on known domains but also on out-of-distribution data and implicitly acts as a defense against MIAs. Specifically, using generative adversarial networks, we are able to produce a potentially infinite number of samples falsely classified as part of the training data. In other words, the threat of MIAs is overestimated, and less information is leaked than previously assumed. Moreover, there is actually a trade-off between the overconfidence of models and their susceptibility to MIAs: the more classifiers know when they do not know, making low confidence predictions, the more they reveal the training data.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0422.pdf"

Moreover, for bilevel optimization, we propose an improved Neumann-IFT algorithm to obtain an approximate solution, which is more stable and accurate than existing optimization methods. Besides, it makes the bilevel optimization process memory-efficient and scalable to large graphs. Experiments on node classification and scene graph generation show that our method can outperform related methods, especially with noisy graphs.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0424.pdf"

Recently, many large multi-modal datasets have been collected, on which researchers actively explore different methods of fusing multi-modal information. However, little attention has been paid to quantifying the contribution of different modalities within the proposed models. In this paper, we propose the SHapley vAlue-based PErceptual (SHAPE) scores that measure the marginal contribution of individual modalities and the degree of cooperation across modalities. Using these scores, we systematically evaluate different fusion methods on different multi-modal datasets for different tasks. Our experiments suggest that for some tasks where different modalities are complementary, the multi-modal models still tend to use the dominant modality alone and ignore the cooperation across modalities. On the other hand, models learn to exploit cross-modal cooperation when different modalities are indispensable for the task. In this case, the scores indicate it is better to fuse different modalities at relatively early stages. We hope our scores can help improve the understanding of how the present multi-modal models operate on different modalities and encourage more sophisticated methods of integrating multiple modalities.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0425.pdf"

The feature extracted from the encoder is enhanced to be more domain-invariant by a similarity learning task using the proposed Semantic Similarity Mining (SSM) module which has a strong help of domain adaptation. The domain-invariant latent feature is then fused into the target domain segmentation sub-network, trained using the original target domain images and the translated target images from the source domain in the framework of adversarial training. The adversarial training is effective to narrow the remaining gap between domains in semantic space after appearance alignment.

In this work, we study topology reconstruction of a diffusion network with incomplete observations of the node infection statuses. To this end, we iteratively infer the network topology based on observed infection statuses and estimated values for unobserved infection statuses by investigating the correlation of node infections, and learn the most probable probabilities of the infection propagations among nodes w.r.t. current inferred topology, as well as the corresponding probability distribution of each unobserved infection status, which in turn helps update the estimate of unobserved data.

The channel features are firstly extracted by Global Average Pooling (GAP) from a batch of samples, and a graph model for each layer is generated based on the similarity of features. A set of agents for individual CNN layers are implemented by GCN and utilized to synthesize comprehensive channel information and determine the pruning scheme for the overall CNN model. The training process of each agent is carried out using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to ensure their convergence and adaptability to various network architectures. The proposed solution is assessed based on a range of image classification datasets i.e., CIFAR and Tiny-ImageNet. The numerical results indicate that the proposed pruning method outperforms the pure magnitude-based or similarity-based pruning solutions and other SOTA methods (e.g., HRank and SCP).

Many variants of graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged to learn graph-structured data where underlying graphs are static, although graphs in various real-world applications are dynamic (e.g., evolving structure). To consider the dynamic nature that a graph changes over time, the need for applying incremental learning (i.e., continual learning or lifelong learning) to the graph domain has been emphasized. However, unlike incremental learning on Euclidean data, graph-structured data contains dependency between the existing nodes and newly appeared nodes, resulting in the phenomenon that receptive fields of existing nodes vary by new inputs (e.g., nodes and edges). In this paper, we raise a crucial challenge of incremental learning for dynamic graphs as time-varying receptive fields, and propose a novel incremental learning framework, DyGRAIN, to mitigate time-varying receptive fields and catastrophic forgetting.

A line of recent works have focused on the problem setting where the preferences of one-side market participants are unknown a priori and are learned by iteratively interacting with the other side of participants. All these works are based on explore-then-commit (ETC) and upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms, two common strategies in multi-armed bandits (MAB). Thompson sampling (TS) is another popular approach, which attracts lots of attention due to its easier implementation and better empirical performances. In many problems, even when UCB and ETC-type algorithms have already been analyzed, researchers are still trying to study TS for its benefits. However, the convergence analysis of TS is much more challenging and remains open in many problem settings. In this paper, we provide the first regret analysis for TS in the new setting of iterative matching markets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the practical advantages of the TS-type algorithm over the ETC and UCB-type baselines.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0439.pdf"

However, existing methods use channel-wise importance weights with specific architectural assumptions, relying on arbitrarily chosen attribution threshold values in their quality assessment: we think these can degrade the quality of attribution. In this paper, we propose Libra-CAM, a new CAM-style attribution method based on the best linear approximation of the layer (as a function) between the penultimate activation and the target-class score output. From the approximation, we derive the base formula of Libra-CAM, which is applied with multiple reference activations from a pre-built library.

Traditional learning methods for GMM such as expectation maximization (EM) require the covariance of the Gaussian components to be non-singular, a condition that is often not satisfied in real-world applications. This paper presents a new learning method called G$^2$M$^2$ (General Gaussian Mixture Model) by fitting an unnormalized Gaussian mixture function (UGMF) to a data distribution. At the core of G$^2$M$^2$ is the introduction of an integral cosine similarity (ICS) function for comparing the UGMF and the unknown data density distribution without having to explicitly estimate it. By maximizing the ICS through Monte Carlo sampling, the UGMF can be made to overlap with the unknown data density distribution such that the two only differ by a constant scalar, and the UGMF can be normalized to obtain the data density distribution. A Siamese convolutional neural network is also designed for optimizing the ICS function. Experimental results show that our method is more competitive in modeling data having correlations that may lead to singular covariance matrices in GMM, and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised anomaly detection.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0444.pdf"

However, the inconsistency of the objective forms not only severely limits the generalization of pre-trained VL models to downstream tasks, but also requires a large amount of labeled data for fine-tuning. To alleviate the problem, we propose an innovative VL fine-tuning paradigm (named Declaration-based Prompt Tuning, abbreviated as DPT), which fine-tunes the model for downstream VQA using the pre-training objectives, boosting the effective adaptation of pre-trainedmodels to the downstream task. Specifically, DPT reformulates the VQA task via (1) textual adaptation, which converts the given questions into declarative sentence form for prompt-tuning, and (2) task adaptation, which optimizes the objective function of VQA problem in the manner of pre-training phase. Experimental results on GQA dataset show that DPT outperforms the fine-tuned counterpart by a large margin regarding accuracy in both fully-supervised (2.68%) and zero-shot/fewshot (over 31%) settings. All the data and codes will be available to facilitate future research.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0453.pdf"

We assume that the unknown signal lies near the range of a Lipschitz continuous generative model with bounded inputs. In particular, we consider two cases when the nonlinear link function is either unknown or known. For unknown nonlinearity, we make the assumption of sub-Gaussian observations and propose a linear least-squares estimator. We show that when there is no representation error, the sensing vectors are Gaussian, and the number of samples is sufficiently large, with high probability, a PGD algorithm converges linearly to a point achieving the optimal statistical rate using arbitrary initialization. For known nonlinearity, we assume monotonicity, and make much weaker assumptions on the sensing vectors and allow for representation error. We propose a nonlinear least-squares estimator that is guaranteed to enjoy an optimal statistical rate. A corresponding PGD algorithm is provided and is shown to also converge linearly to the estimator using arbitrary initialization.

To overcome this problem, we present a simple and effective method self-ensemble label correction (SELC) to progressively correct noisy labels and refine the model. We look deeper into the memorization behavior in training with noisy labels and observe that the network outputs are reliable in the early stage. To retain this reliable knowledge, SELC uses ensemble predictions formed by an exponential moving average of network outputs to update the original noisy labels. We show that training with SELC refines the model by gradually reducing supervision from noisy labels and increasing supervision from ensemble predictions. Despite its simplicity, compared with many state-of-the-art methods, SELC obtains more promising and stable results in the presence of class-conditional, instance-dependent, and real-world label noise.

The basic principle of PLL is that the unknown correct label y of an instance x resides in its candidate label set s, i.e., P(y ∈ s | x) = 1. On which basis, current researches either directly model P(x | y) under different data generation assumptions or propose various surrogate multiclass losses, which all aim to encourage the model-based Pθ(y ∈ s | x)→1 implicitly. In this work, instead, we explicitly construct a binary classification task toward P(y ∈ s | x) based on the discriminative model, that is to predict whether the model-output label of x is one of its candidate labels. We formulate a novel risk estimator with estimation error bound for the proposed PLL binary classification risk. By applying logit adjustment based on disambiguation strategy, the practical approach directly maximizes Pθ(y ∈ s | x) while implicitly disambiguating the correct one from candidate labels simultaneously.

In this paper, we show that the vanilla DSAE suffers from being sensitive to the choice of model architecture and capacity of the dynamic latent variables, and is prone to collapse the static latent variable. As a countermeasure, we propose TS-DSAE, a two-stage training framework that first learns sequence-level prior distributions, which are subsequently employed to regularise the model and facilitate auxiliary objectives to promote disentanglement. The proposed framework is fully unsupervised and robust against the global factor collapse problem across a wide range of model configurations. It also avoids typical solutions such as adversarial training which usually involves laborious parameter tuning, and domain-specific data augmentation.

COMET Flows capture heavy-tailed marginal distributions by combining a parametric tail belief at extreme quantiles of the marginals with an empirical kernel density function at mid-quantiles. In addition, COMET Flows capture asymmetric tail dependence among multivariate extremes by viewing such dependence as inducing a low-dimensional manifold structure in feature space.

The crux of the innovation is that, unlike existing adversarial attacks that rely on gradient estimation and additive noise, FastDrop generates adversarial examples by dropping information in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that FastDrop can escape the detection of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) black-box defenses and reduce the number of queries by 13~133× under the same level of perturbations compared with the SOTA attacks. FastDrop only needs 10~20 queries to conduct an attack against various black-box models within 1s. Besides, on commercial vision APIs provided by Baidu and Tencent, FastDrop achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of 100% with 10 queries on average, which poses a real and severe threat to real-world applications.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0464.pdf"

Herein, we establish the first systematic exploration of the latent manifolds' geometry under the deep clustering paradigm; we study the evolution of their intrinsic dimension and linear intrinsic dimension. We find that the embedded manifolds undergo coarse geometric transformations under the transition regime: from curved low-dimensional to flattened higher-dimensional. Moreover, we find that this inappropriate flattening leads to clustering deterioration by twisting the curved structures.

These weak supervisions are much more cheaper and easy to collect in real-world scenarios. To resolve this task, we propose a novel deep classification model, namely Weakly-supervised Text Classification with Wasserstein Barycenter Regularization (WTC-WBR). Specifically, we initialize the pseudo-labels of texts by using the category word occurrences, and formulate a weakly self-training framework to iteratively update the weakly-supervised targets by combining the pseudo-labels with the sharpened predictions. Most importantly, we suggest a Wasserstein barycenter regularization with the weakly-supervised targets on the deep feature space. The intuition is that the texts tend to be close to the corresponding Wasserstein barycenter indicated by weakly-supervised targets. Another benefit is that the regularization can capture the geometric information of deep feature space to boost the discriminative power of deep features. Experimental results demonstrate that WTC-WBR outperforms the existing weakly-supervised baselines, and achieves comparable performance to semi-supervised and supervised baselines.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0468.pdf"

We discover that the effect of attacks crucially depends on whether the rewards are bounded or unbounded. In bounded reward settings, we show that only reward manipulation or only action manipulation cannot guarantee a successful attack. However,  by combining reward and action manipulation,  the adversary can manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy with \Theta(\sqrt{T})  total attack cost, which is order-optimal, without any knowledge of the underlying MDP. In contrast, in unbounded reward settings, we show that reward manipulation attacks are sufficient for an adversary to successfully manipulate any order-optimal learning algorithm to follow any targeted policy using \tilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) amount of contamination.

Nevertheless, the notorious weakness in generalization among environments prevent widespread application of DRL agents in real-world scenarios. Although advances have been made recently, most prior works assume sufficient online interaction on training environments, which can be costly in practical cases.To this end, we focus on an offline-training-online-adaptation setting,in which the agent first learns from offline experiences collected in environments with different dynamics and then performs online policy adaptation in environments with new dynamics. In this paper, we propose Policy Adaptation with Decoupled Representations (PAnDR) for fast policy adaptation.In offline training phase, the environment representation and policy representation are learned through contrastive learning and policy recovery, respectively. The representations are further refined by mutual information optimization to make them more decoupled and complete. With learned representations, a Policy-Dynamics Value Function (PDVF)  network is trained to approximate the values for different combinations of policies and environments from offline experiences. In online adaptation phase, with the environment context inferred from few experiences collected in new environments, the policy is optimized by gradient ascent with respect to the PDVF.

To tackle this issue, we propose FedMAT, a Federated Multi-task ATtention framework for HAR, which extracts and fuses shared as well as individual-specific multi-modal sensor data features. Specifically, we treat the HAR problem associated with each individual as a different task and train a federated multi-task model, composed of a shared feature representation network in a central server plus multiple individual-specific networks with attention modules stored in decentralized nodes. In this architecture, the attention module operates as a mask that allows to learn individual-specific features from the global model, whilst simultaneously allowing for features to be shared among different individuals. We conduct extensive experiments based on publicly available HAR datasets, which are collected in both controlled environments and real-world scenarios.

Nevertheless, we empirically find that not all samples are equally important and hence simply injecting more augmented inputs may instead cause instability in Q-learning. In this paper, we approach this problem systematically by developing a model-agnostic Contrastive-Curiosity-driven Learning Framework (CCLF), which can fully exploit sample importance and improve learning efficiency in a self-supervised manner. Facilitated by the proposed contrastive curiosity, CCLF is capable of prioritizing the experience replay, selecting the most informative augmented inputs, and more importantly regularizing the Q-function as well as the encoder to concentrate more on under-learned data. Moreover, it encourages the agent to explore with a curiosity-based reward. As a result, the agent can focus on more informative samples and learn representation invariances more efficiently, with significantly reduced augmented inputs.

This indeed fails to unleash the complete expressive power of multimodal fusion with restricted number of modalities and fixed interactive direction.In this work, the multiway multimodal transformer (MMT) is proposed to simultaneously explore multiway multimodal intercorrelations for each modality via single block rather than multiple stacked cross-modality blocks. The core idea of MMT is the multiway multimodal attention, where the multiple modalities are leveraged to compute the multiway attention tensor. This naturally benefits us to exploit comprehensive many-to-many multimodal interactive paths. Specifically, the multiway tensor is comprised of multiple interconnected modality-aware core tensors that consist of the intramodal interactions. Additionally, the tensor contraction operation is utilized to investigate intermodal dependencies between distinct core tensors.Essentially, our tensor-based multiway structure allows for easily extending MMT to the case associated with an arbitrary number of modalities. Taking MMT as the basis, the hierarchical network is further established to recursively transmit the low-level multiway multimodal interactions to high-level ones. The experiments demonstrate that MMT can achieve state-of-the-art or comparable performance.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0480.pdf"

The proposed method is based on a human-like attention mechanism that allows the agent to learn by observing what is moving in the attended locations. Spatio-temporal stochastic coherence along the attention trajectory, paired with a contrastive term, leads to an unsupervised learning criterion that naturally copes with the considered setting. Differently from most existing works, the learned representations are used in open-set class-incremental classification of each frame pixel, relying on few supervisions. Our experiments leverage 3D virtual environments and they show that the proposed agents can learn to distinguish objects just by observing the video stream.

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel graph-oriented imputation framework called initializing then refining (ITR), where we first employ the structure information for initial imputation, and then leverage observed attribute and structure information to adaptively refine the imputed latent variables. Specifically, we first adopt the structure embeddings of attribute-missing samples as the embedding initialization, and then refine these initial values by aggregating the reliable and informative embeddings of attribute-observed samples according to the affinity structure. Specially, in our refining process, the affinity structure is adaptively updated through iterations by calculating the sample-wise correlations upon the recomposed embeddings.

In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task personalized learning method to handle these challenges. For 1), each model is decomposed into a sum of global and local components, that saves sample homogeneity and sample heterogeneity, respectively. For 2), regularized by sparse network Lasso, the joint models are embedded into a low-dimensional subspace and exhibit sparse group structures, leading to a significantly reduced number of effective parameters. For 3), the subspace is further separated into two parts, so as to save both commonality and specificity of tasks.

However, most existing works assume both tasks are sampled from a stationary task distribution, thereby leading to the sub-optimal performance for dynamic tasks drawn from a non-stationary task distribution in real scenarios. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we study a more realistic and challenging transfer learning setting with dynamic tasks, i.e., source and target tasks are continuously evolving over time. We theoretically show that the expected error on the dynamic target task can be tightly bounded in terms of source knowledge and consecutive distribution discrepancy across tasks. This result motivates us to propose a generic meta-learning framework L2E for modeling the knowledge transferability on dynamic tasks. It is centered around a task-guided meta-learning problem with a group of meta-pairs of tasks, based on which we are able to learn the prior model initialization for fast adaptation on the newest target task. L2E enjoys the following properties: (1) effective knowledge transferability across dynamic tasks; (2) fast adaptation to the new target task; (3) mitigation of catastrophic forgetting on historical target tasks; and (4) flexibility in incorporating any existing static transfer learning algorithms.

Inspired by structural entropy on graphs, we transform the data sample from graphs to coding trees, which is a simpler but essential structure for graph data. Furthermore, we propose a novel message passing scheme, termed hierarchical reporting, in which features are transferred from leaf nodes to root nodes by following the hierarchical structure of coding trees. We then present a tree kernel and a convolutional network to implement our scheme for graph classification. With the designed message passing scheme, the tree kernel and convolutional network have a lower runtime complexity of O(n) than Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and other graph neural networks of at least O(hm).

Specifically, parameter initialization only conducts a multi-classification task on the base classes, resulting in good generalization ability and less time cost. Parameter fine-tuning designs two data augmentation methods (i.e., support augmentation and shot augmentation) on the novel classes to generate sufficient node features so that any traditional supervised classifiers can be used to classify the query set.

Most existing PLL works directly eliminate, rather than exploiting the label ambiguity, since they explicitly or implicitly assume that incorrect CLs are noise independent of the instance. While a more practical setting in the wild should be instance-dependent, namely, the CLs depend on both the true label and the instance itself, such that each CL may describe the instance from some sensory channel, thereby providing some noisy but really valid information about the instance. In this paper, we leverage such additional information acquired from the ambiguity and propose AmBiguity-induced contrastive LEarning (ABLE) under the framework of contrastive learning. Specifically, for each CL of an anchor, we select a group of samples currently predicted as that class as ambiguity-induced positives, based on which we synchronously learn a representor (RP) that minimizes the weighted sum of contrastive losses of all groups and a classifier (CS) that minimizes a classification loss. Although they are circularly dependent: RP requires the ambiguity-induced positives on-the-fly induced by CS, and CS needs the first half of RP as the representation extractor, ABLE still enables RP and CS to be trained simultaneously within a coherent framework.

Previous studies have alluded to this fact but have not examined it in depth.In this paper, we address the tractability of reinforcement learning for general LTL objectives from a theoretical perspective.We formalize the problem under the probably approximately correct learning in Markov decision processes (PAC-MDP) framework, a standard framework for measuring sample complexity in reinforcement learning.In this formalization, we prove that the optimal policy for any LTL formula is PAC-MDP-learnable if and only if the formula is in the most limited class in the LTL hierarchy, consisting of formulas that are decidable within a finite horizon.Practically, our result implies that it is impossible for a reinforcement-learning algorithm to obtain a PAC-MDP guarantee on the performance of its learned policy after finitely many interactions with an unconstrained environment for LTL objectives that are not decidable within a finite horizon.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0507.pdf"

Take financial trading as an example, the market information is noisy yet imperfect and the macroeconomic regulation or other factors may shift between training and evaluation, thus it requires both generalization and high sample efficiency for resolving the task. However, directly applying typical RL algorithms can lead to poor performance in such scenarios. To derive a robust and applicable RL algorithm, in this work, we design a simple but effective method named Ensemble Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO), which learns ensemble policies in an end-to-end manner. Notably, EPPO combines each policy and the policy ensemble organically and optimizes both simultaneously. In addition, EPPO adopts a diversity enhancement regularization over the policy space which helps to generalize to unseen states and promotes exploration. We theoretically prove that EPPO can increase exploration efficacy, and through comprehensive experimental evaluations on various tasks, we demonstrate that EPPO achieves higher efficiency and is robust for real-world applications compared with vanilla policy optimization algorithms and other ensemble methods.

These methods generally assume that the entire unlabeled data of unknown target subjects are available in training phase.  However, this assumption does not hold in some practical scenarios where the data of target subjects arrive one by one in an online manner instead of being acquired at a time. Thus, existing DA methods cannot be directly applied in this case since the unknown target data is inaccessible in training phase. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel online cross-subject ECG emotion recognition method leveraging hypergraph-based online transfer learning (HOTL). Specifically, the proposed hypergraph structure is capable of learning the high-order correlation among data, such that the recognition model trained on source subjects can be more effectively generalized to target subjects. Meanwhile, the structure can be easily updated by adding a hyperedge which connects a newly coming sample with the current hypergraph, resulting in further reduce the individual differences in online manner without re-training the model. Consequently, HOTL can effectively deal with the online cross-subject scenario where unknown target ECG data arrive one by one and varying overtime. Extensive experiments conducted on the Amigos dataset validate the superiority of the proposed method.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0509.pdf"

Most of the existing methods for safe reinforcement learning can only handle transition disturbance or observation disturbance since these two kinds of disturbance affect different parts of the agent;   besides, the popular worst-case return may lead to overly pessimistic policies. To address these issues, we first theoretically prove that the performance degradation under transition disturbance and observation disturbance depends on a novel metric of Value Function Range (VFR), which corresponds to the gap in the value function between the best state and the worst state. Based on the analysis, we adopt conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) as an assessment of risk and propose a novel reinforcement learning algorithm of CVaR-Proximal-Policy-Optimization (CPPO) which formalizes the risk-sensitive constrained optimization problem by keeping its CVaR under a given threshold. Experimental results show that CPPO achieves a higher cumulative reward and is more robust against both observation and transition disturbances on a series of continuous control tasks in MuJoCo.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0510.pdf"

An effective remedy is adversarial weight perturbation, which injects the worst-case weight perturbation during network training by maximizing the classification loss on adversarial examples. Adversarial weight perturbation helps reduce the robust generalization gap; however, it also undermines the robustness improvement. A criterion that regulates the weight perturbation is therefore crucial for adversarial training. In this paper, we propose such a criterion, namely Loss Stationary Condition (LSC) for constrained perturbation. With LSC, we find that it is essential to conduct weight perturbation on adversarial data with small classification loss to eliminate robust overfitting. Weight perturbation on adversarial data with large classification loss is not necessary and may even lead to poor robustness. Based on these observations, we propose a robust perturbation strategy to constrain the extent of weight perturbation. The perturbation strategy prevents deep networks from overfitting while avoiding the side effect of excessive weight perturbation,  significantly improving the robustness of adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art adversarial training methods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0512.pdf"

We extend this idea further to explicitly capture the intra-class variations in a one-to-many manner. Specifically, MFGN consists of an encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that performs as a feature extractor and extracts the feature embeddings of the available visual instances (the unavailable instances are seen to be masked), along with a decoder that performs as a feature generator and reconstructs the feature embeddings of the unavailable visual instances from both the available feature embeddings and the masked tokens. Equipped with this generative architecture, MFGN produces nontrivial visual features for the novel classes with limited visual instances. In extensive experiments on four FSL benchmarks, MFGN performs competitively and outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors on most of the few-shot classification tasks.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0513.pdf"

Recently, data augmentation techniques aiming at enhancing data diversity have demonstrated proven performance in improving the generalization ability of learned policies. However, due to the sensitivity of RL training, naively applying data augmentation, which transforms each pixel in a task-agnostic manner, may suffer from instability and damage the sample efficiency, thus further exacerbating the generalization performance. At the heart of this phenomenon is the diverged action distribution and high-variance value estimation in the face of augmented images. To alleviate this issue, we propose Task-aware Lipschitz Data Augmentation (TLDA) for visual RL, which  explicitly identifies the task-correlated pixels with large Lipschitz constants, and only augments the task-irrelevant pixels for stability. We verify the effectiveness of our approach on DeepMind Control suite, CARLA and DeepMind Manipulation tasks.

We propose an explicitly implementable and provably order-optimal sample-complexity algorithm for best arm identification. Existing approaches that achieve optimal sample complexity assume either access to a nontrivial minimax optimization oracle (e.g. RAGE and Lazy-TS) or knowledge of an upper-bound on the norm of the unknown parameter vector(e.g. LinGame). Our algorithm, which we call the Phased Elimination Linear Exploration Game (PELEG), maintains a high-probability confidence ellipsoid containing the unknown vector, and uses it to eliminate suboptimal arms in phases, where a minimax problem is essentially solved in each phase using two-player low regret learners. PELEG does not require to know a bound on norm of the unknown vector, and is asymptotically-optimal, settling an open problem. We show that the sample complexity of PELEG matches, up to order and in a non-asymptotic sense, an instance-dependent universal lower bound for linear bandits. PELEG is thus the first algorithm to achieve both order-optimal sample complexity and explicit implementability for this setting.

Unfortunately, existing offline RL methods still face many practical challenges in real-world system control tasks, such as computational restriction during agent training and the requirement of extra control flexibility. The model-based planning framework provides an attractive alternative. However, most model-based planning algorithms are not designed for offline settings. Simply combining the ingredients of offline RL with existing methods either provides over-restrictive planning or leads to inferior performance. We propose a new light-weighted model-based offline planning framework, namely MOPP, which tackles the dilemma between the restrictions of offline learning and high-performance planning. MOPP encourages more aggressive trajectory rollout guided by the behavior policy learned from data, and prunes out problematic trajectories to avoid potential out-of-distribution samples.

However, current algorithms still struggle for efficient policy updates with hard constraint satisfaction. In this paper, we propose Penalized Proximal Policy Optimization (P3O), which solves the cumbersome constrained policy iteration via a single minimization of an equivalent unconstrained problem. Specifically, P3O utilizes a simple yet effective penalty approach to eliminate cost constraints and removes the trust-region constraint by the clipped surrogate objective. We theoretically prove the exactness of the penalized method with a finite penalty factor and provide a worst-case analysis for approximate error when evaluated on sample trajectories. Moreover, we extend P3O to more challenging multi-constraint and multi-agent scenarios which are less studied in previous work. Extensive experiments show that P3O outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with respect to both reward improvement and constraint satisfaction on a set of constrained locomotive tasks.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0520.pdf"

To fill this gap, we propose a novel Context-aware Future Preference inference Recommender (CFPRec) to help infer user future preference in a self-ensembling manner. In particular, it delicately derives multi-step future preferences from the learned past preference thanks to the periodic property of users' daily check-ins, so as to implicitly mimic user’s activity planning before her next visit. The inferred future preferences are then seamlessly integrated with the current preference for more expressive user preference learning.

However, insightful analysis of such data under an unsupervised scenario using clustering is extremely challenging because the information provided by the two different types of attributes is heterogeneous, being at different concept hierarchies. That is, the values of a categorical attribute represent a set of different concepts (e.g., professor, lawyer, and doctor of the attribute ""occupation""), while the values of a numerical attribute describe the tendencies toward two different concepts (e.g., low and high of the attribute ""income""). To appropriately use such heterogeneous information in clustering, this paper therefore proposes a novel attribute representation learning method called Het2Hom, which first converts the heterogeneous attributes into a homogeneous form, and then learns attribute representations and data partitions on such a homogeneous basis.

In MLL, the implicit relative importance of different labels representing a single instance is generally different, which recently gained considerable attention and should be fully leveraged. Therefore, label enhancement (LE) has been widely applied in various MLL tasks as the ability to effectively mine the implicit relative importance information of different labels. However, due to the fact that the label enhancement process in previous LE-based MLL methods is decoupled from the training process on the predictive models, the objective of LE does not match the training process and finally affects the whole learning system. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Fusion Label Enhancement for Multi-label learning (FLEM) to effectively integrate the LE process and the training process. Specifically, we design a matching and interaction mechanism which leverages a novel interaction label enhancement loss to avoid that the recovered label distribution does not match the need of the predictive model. In the meantime, we present a unified label distribution loss for establishing the corresponding relationship between the recovered label distribution and the training of the predictive model. With the proposed loss, the label distributions recovered from the LE process can be efficiently utilized for training the predictive model.

Such models significantly generalize the standard PL and RUMs, but are not as well investigated in the literature. We extend mixtures of RUMs with features to models that generate incomplete preferences and characterize their identifiability. For PL, we prove that when PL with features is identifiable, its MLE is consistent with a strictly concave objective function under mild assumptions, by characterizing a bound on root-mean-square-error (RMSE), which naturally leads to a sample complexity bound. We also characterize identifiability of more general RUMs with features and propose a generalized RBCML to learn them.

Previous works employ cross-modal instance discrimination tasks to establish the correlation of voice and face. These methods neglect the semantic content of different videos, introducing false-negative pairs as training noise. Furthermore, the positive pairs are constructed based on the natural correlation between audio clips and visual frames. However, this correlation might be weak or inaccurate in a large amount of real-world data, which leads to deviating positives into the contrastive paradigm. To address these issues, we propose the cross-modal prototype contrastive learning (CMPC), which takes advantage of contrastive methods and resists adverse effects of false negatives and deviate positives. On one hand, CMPC could learn the intra-class invariance by constructing semantic-wise positives via unsupervised clustering in different modalities. On the other hand, by comparing the similarities of cross-modal instances from that of cross-modal prototypes, we dynamically recalibrate the unlearnable instances' contribution to overall loss. Experiments show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on various voice-face association evaluation protocols. Additionally, in the low-shot supervision setting, our method also has a significant improvement compared to previous instance-wise contrastive learning.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0526.pdf"

In the context of machine learning, this requires a model to forget about a training data sample if requested by the data owner (i.e., machine unlearning). As an essential step prior to machine unlearning, it is still a challenge for a data owner to tell whether or not her data have been used by an unauthorized party to train a machine learning model. Membership inference is a recently emerging technique to identify whether a data sample was used to train a target model, and seems to be a promising solution to this challenge. However, straightforward adoption of existing membership inference approaches fails to address the challenge effectively due to being originally designed for attacking membership privacy and suffering from several severe limitations such as low inference accuracy on well-generalized models. In this paper, we propose a novel membership inference approach inspired by the backdoor technology to address the said challenge. Specifically, our approach of Membership Inference via Backdooring (MIB) leverages the key observation that a backdoored model behaves very differently from a clean model when predicting on deliberately marked samples created by a data owner.

We perform extensive experiments on various datasets and deep neural network architectures, and the results validate the efficacy of our approach, e.g., marking only 0.1% of the training dataset is practically sufficient for effective membership inference.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0532.pdf"

PDEs with a point source that is expressed as a Dirac delta function in the governing equations are mathematical models of many physical processes. However, they cannot be solved directly by conventional PINNs method due to the singularity brought by the Dirac delta function. In this paper, we propose a universal solution to tackle this problem by proposing three novel techniques.  Firstly the Dirac delta function is modeled as a continuous probability density function to eliminate the singularity at the point source; secondly a lower bound constrained uncertainty weighting algorithm is proposed to balance the physics-informed loss terms of point source area and the remaining areas; and thirdly a multi-scale deep neural network with periodic activation function is used to improve the accuracy and convergence speed. We evaluate the proposed method with three representative PDEs, and the experimental results show that our method outperforms existing deep learning based methods with respect to the accuracy, the efficiency and the versatility.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0533.pdf"

Contrastive learning could potentially lead to false negative pair assignments in sleep signal data. Moreover, existing data augmentation techniques directly modify the original signal data, making it likely to lose important information. To mitigate these issues, we propose Self-Supervised Learning with Attention-aided Positive Pairs (SSLAPP).

Instead in the pixel (spatial) coordinate system of image space, the physical law is modeled in a regressed underlying physical coordinate system where the physical states follow potential explicit governing equations. A numerical integrator-based sparse regression module is designed and serves as a physical constraint to the autoencoder and coordinate system regression, and, in the meanwhile, uncover the parsimonious closed-form governing equations from the learned physical states.

Studies have found that reinforcement learning (RL) can help decide the order-splitting sizes. However, a problem remains unsolved: how to place limit orders at appropriate limit prices?The key challenge lies in the ``continuous-discrete duality'' of the action space. On the one hand, the continuous action space using percentage changes in prices is preferred for generalization. On the other hand, the trader eventually needs to choose limit prices discretely due to the existence of the tick size, which requires specialization for every single stock with different characteristics (e.g., the liquidity and the price range). So we need continuous control for generalization and discrete control for specialization. To this end, we propose a hybrid RL method to combine the advantages of both of them. We first use a continuous control agent to scope an action subset, then deploy a fine-grained agent to choose a specific limit price.

To address this gap between offline and online problems, we introduce a novel formulation, the offline vehicle routing problem with online bookings. This problem is very challenging computationally since it faces the complexity of considering large sets of requests—similar to offline VRPs—but must abide by strict constraints on running time—similar to online VRPs. To solve this problem, we propose a novel computational approach, which combines an anytime algorithm with a learning-based policy for real-time decisions. Based on a paratransit dataset obtained from the public transit agency of Chattanooga, TN, we demonstrate that our novel formulation and computational approach lead to significantly better outcomes in this setting than existing algorithms.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0546.pdf"

Many voting rules, like plurality, are shown to be vulnerable as the attacker can target specific voters to manipulate the result. What if a local differential privacy (LDP) mechanism is adopted such that the true preference of a voter is never revealed in pre-election polls? In this case, the attacker can only infer stochastic information about a voter's true preference, and this may cause the manipulation of the electoral result significantly harder. The goal of this paper is to provide a quantitative study on the effect of adopting LDP mechanisms on a voting system. We introduce the metric PoLDP (power of LDP) that quantitatively measures the difference between the attacker's manipulation cost under LDP mechanisms and that without LDP mechanisms. The larger PoLDP is, the more robustness LDP mechanisms can add to a voting system. We give a full characterization of PoLDP for the voting system with plurality rule and provide general guidance towards the application of LDP mechanisms.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0547.pdf"

Instead of the case where the loss function is Lipschitz or each coordinate of the gradient has bounded second moment studied previously, we consider a relaxed scenario where  each coordinate of the gradient only has bounded (1+v)-th moment with some v∈(0, 1]. Firstly, we start from the one dimensional private mean estimation for heavy-tailed distributions. We propose a novel robust and private mean estimator which is optimal. Based on its idea, we then extend to the general d-dimensional space and study DP-SCO with general convex and strongly convex loss functions. We also provide  lower bounds for these two classes of loss under our setting and show that our upper bounds are optimal up to a factor of  O(Poly(d)). To address the high dimensionality issue, we also study DP-SCO with heavy-tailed gradient under some sparsity constraint (DP sparse learning).

To this end, this is the first work that comprehensively investigates adversarial attacks and defense mechanisms for DRL-based power system emergency control. In particular, recovery-targeted (RT) adversarial attacks are designed for gradient-based approaches, aiming to dramatically degrade the effectiveness of the conducted emergency control actions to prevent the system from restoring to a stable state. Furthermore, the corresponding robust defense (RD) mechanisms are proposed to actively modify the observations based on the distances of sequential states. Experiments are conducted based on the standard IEEE reliability test system, and the results show that security risks indeed exist in the state-of-the-art DRL-based power system emergency control models.

Moreover, they mainly extract review semantics via sequential or attentive models, whereas the rich text associated knowledge is largely neglected. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous interactive snapshot network for stock profiling and recommendation. We model investment reviews in each snapshot as a heterogeneous document graph, and develop a flexible hierarchical attentive propagation framework to capture fine-grained proximity features. Further, to learn stock embedding for ranking, we introduce a novel twins-GRU method, which tightly couples the media and price parallel sequences in a cross-interactive fashion to catch dynamic dependencies between successive snapshots.

Attention heads in stacked layers gradually harvest short- and long-term transition traits, spontaneously boosting the diversity of representations.

Existing attack methods construct such adversaries by randomly selecting some clean data from the benign set and then embedding a trigger into them. However, this selection strategy ignores the fact that each poisoned sample contributes inequally to the backdoor injection, which reduces the efficiency of poisoning. In this paper, we formulate improving the poisoned data efficiency by the selection as an optimization problem and propose a Filtering-and-Updating Strategy (FUS) to solve it.

The latest research tends to solve this problem in a unified framework solely based on surface form matching between mentions and entities. Specifically, these methods focus on addressing the variety challenge of the heterogeneous naming of biomedical concepts. Yet, the ambiguity challenge that the same word under different contexts may refer to distinct entities is usually ignored. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage linking algorithm to enhance the entity representations based on prompt learning. The first stage includes a coarser-grained retrieval from a representation space defined by a bi-encoder that independently embeds the mention and entity’s surface forms. Unlike previous one-model-fits-all systems, each candidate is then re-ranked with a finer-grained encoder based on prompt-tuning that utilizes the contextual information. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves promising performance improvements compared with several state-of-the-art techniques on the largest biomedical public dataset MedMentions and the NCBI disease corpus. We also observe by cases that the proposed prompt-tuning strategy is effective in solving both the variety and ambiguity challenges in the linking task.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0560.pdf"

In addition, the noises of AMR (i.e., tags unrelated to IE tasks, nodes with unconcerned conception, and edge types with complicated hierarchical structures) disturb the decoding processing of IE. As a result, the decoding processing limited by the AMR cannot be worked effectively.

Finally, in addition to effective probing of these models, we show that training on the generated samples improves the target model’s performance.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0573.pdf"

Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate pre-trained word embeddings independently of downstream tasks. Such evaluations try to assess whether the geometry induced by a word embedding captures connections made in natural language, such as, analogies, clustering of words, or word similarities. Here, traditionally, similarity is measured by comparison to human judgment. However, explicitly annotating word pairs with similarity scores by surveying humans is expensive. We tackle this problem by formulating a similarity measure that is based on an agent for routing the Wikipedia hyperlink graph. In this graph, word similarities are implicitly encoded by edges between articles. We show on the English Wikipedia that our measure correlates well with a large group of traditional similarity measures, while covering a much larger proportion of words and avoiding explicit human labeling. Moreover, since Wikipedia is available in more than 300 languages, our measure can easily be adapted to other languages, in contrast to traditional similarity measures.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0574.pdf"

Specifically, MST-SQL is based on column-wise HydraNet and adopts self-training as an effective mechanism to learn from readily available unlabeled samples. During each epoch of training, it first predicts pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples and then leverages them to update the parameters. A fine-grained ML algorithm is used in updating, which weighs the contribution of columns by their specificity, in order to further improve the generalizability. Extensive experimental results on both open-domain and domain-specific benchmarks reveal that our MST-SQL has significant advantages in few-shot scenarios,  and is also competitive in standard supervised settings.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0576.pdf"

Inspired by Taylor's approximation theory, we propose an interpretable decoupling-style SE framework, which disentangles the complex spectrum recovery into two separate optimization problems i.e., magnitude and complex residual estimation. Specifically, serving as the 0th-order term in Taylor's series, a filter network is delicately devised to suppress the noise component only in the magnitude domain and obtain a coarse spectrum. To refine the phase distribution, we estimate the sparse complex residual, which is defined as the difference between target and coarse spectra, and measures the phase gap. In this study, we formulate the residual component as the combination of various high-order Taylor terms and propose a lightweight trainable module to replace the complicated derivative operator between adjacent terms. Finally, following Taylor's formula, we can reconstruct the target spectrum by the superimposition between 0th-order and high-order terms.

To address this issue, we propose a fast relation extraction model (FastRE) based on convolutional encoder and improved cascade binary tagging framework. Compared to previous work, FastRE employs several innovations to improve efficiency while also keeping promising performance. Concretely, FastRE adopts a novel convolutional encoder architecture combined with dilated convolution, gated unit and residual connection, which significantly reduces the computation cost of training and inference, while maintaining the satisfactory performance. Moreover, to improve the cascade binary tagging framework, FastRE first introduces a type-relation mapping mechanism to accelerate tagging efficiency and alleviate relation redundancy, and then utilizes a position-dependent adaptive thresholding strategy to obtain higher tagging accuracy and better model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that FastRE is well balanced between efficiency and performance, and achieves 3-10$\times$ training speed, 7-15$\times$ inference speed faster, and 1/100 parameters compared to the state-of-the-art models, while the performance is still competitive.

Then during training, DASK injects pivot-related knowledge graph information into source domain texts. For the downstream task, these knowledge-injected texts are fed into a BERT variant capable of processing knowledge-injected textual data. Thanks to the knowledge injection, our model learns domain-invariant features for non-pivots according to their relationships with pivots. DASK ensures the pivots to have domain-invariant behaviors by dynamically inferring via the polarity scores of candidate pivots during training with pseudo-labels. We validate DASK on a wide range of cross-domain sentiment classification tasks and observe up to 2.9% absolute performance improvement over baselines for 20 different domain pairs.

To address this problem, we propose a Parameter-efficient Sparse Training (PST) method to reduce the number of trainable parameters during sparse-aware training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we first combine the data-free and data-driven criteria to efficiently and accurately measure the importance of weights. Then we investigate the intrinsic redundancy of data-driven weight importance and derive two obvious characteristics i.e. low-rankness and structuredness. Based on that, two groups of small matrices are introduced to compute the data-driven importance of weights, instead of using the original large importance score matrix, which therefore makes the sparse training resource-efficient and parameter-efficient.

To provide the benefits of both NMT and SMT, this paper presents a novel model design that enhances NMT with an additional training process for EAL, in addition to the end-to-end translation training. Thus, we propose two approaches an explicit alignment learning approach, in which we further remove the need for the additional alignment model, and perform embedding mixup with the alignment based on encoder--decoder attention weights in the NMT model. We conducted experiments on both small-scale (IWSLT14 De->En and IWSLT13 Fr->En) and large-scale (WMT14 En->De, En->Fr, WMT17 Zh->En) benchmarks. Evaluation results show that our EAL methods significantly outperformed strong baseline methods, which shows the effectiveness of EAL. Further explorations show that the translation improvements are due to a better spatial alignment of the source and target language embeddings. Our method improves translation performance without the need to increase model parameters and training data, which verifies that the idea of incorporating techniques of SMT into NMT is worthwhile.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0587.pdf"

While promising for declarative languages, these approaches achieve much poorer performance on datasets for imperative languages. Since a declarative language is typically embedded in an imperative language (i.e., the turducken-style programming) in real-world software development, the promising results on declarative languages can hardly lead to significant reduction of manual software development efforts.In this paper, we define a new code generation task: given a natural language comment, this task aims to generate a program in a base imperative language with an embedded declarative language. To our knowledge, this is the first turducken-style code generation task. For this task, we present Lyra: a dataset in Python with embedded SQL. This dataset contains 2,000 carefully annotated database manipulation programs from real usage projects. Each program is paired with both a Chinese comment and an English comment. In our experiment, we adopted Transformer, BERT-style, and GPT-style models as baselines. In the best setting, GPT-style model can achieve 24% and 25.5% AST exact matching accuracy using Chinese and English comments, respectively. Therefore, we believe that Lyra provides a new challenge for code generation.

To address this problem, we propose a prompt-based method, termed as PromptDFD, that allows us to take advantage of learned language priors, which effectively harmonizes the synthetic sentences to be semantically and grammatically correct.

It requires the system to explore the cause of help-seeker's emotional distress and understand their psychological intention to provide supportive responses. However, existing methods mainly focus on the sequential contextual information, ignoring the hierarchical relationships with the global cause and local psychological intention behind conversations, thus leads to a weak ability of emotional support. In this paper, we propose a Global-to-Local Hierarchical Graph Network to capture the multi-source information (global cause, local intentions and dialog history) and model hierarchical relationships between them, which consists of a multi-source encoder, a hierarchical graph reasoner, and a global-guide decoder. Furthermore, a novel training objective is designed to monitor semantic information of the global cause. Experimental results on the emotional support conversation dataset, ESConv, confirm that the proposed GLHG has achieved the state-of-the-art performance on the automatic and human evaluations.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0600.pdf"

In contrast to sentence-level relation extraction, it deals with longer texts and more complex entity interactions, which requires reasoning over multiple sentences with rich reasoning skills. Most current researches construct a document-level graph first, and then focus on the overall graph structure or the paths between the target entity pair in the graph. In this paper, we propose a novel subgraph reasoning (SGR) framework for document-level relation extraction. SGR combines the advantages of both graph-based models and path-based models, integrating various paths between the target entity pair into a much simpler subgraph structure to perform relational reasoning. Moreover, the paths generated by our designed heuristic strategy explicitly model the requisite reasoning skills and roughly cover the supporting sentences for each relation instance. Experimental results on DocRED show that SGR outperforms existing models, and further analyses demonstrate that our method is both effective and explainable.

We first construct a High-frequency Enhancement Distillation scheme for the binarization-aware training, which emphasizes the high-frequency information from the full-precision network's representation that is more crucial for the optimization of the binarized network. Then, to allow the instant and adaptive accuracy-efficiency trade-offs at runtime, we also propose a Thinnable Binarization Architecture to further liberate the acceleration potential of the binarized network from the topology perspective. Moreover, we implement a Fast Bitwise Computation Kernel for BiFSMN on ARMv8 devices which fully utilizes registers and increases instruction throughput to push the limit of deployment efficiency. Extensive experiments show that BiFSMN outperforms existing binarization methods by convincing margins on various datasets and is even comparable with the full-precision counterpart (e.g., less than 3% drop on Speech Commands V1-12). We highlight that benefiting from the thinnable architecture and the optimized 1-bit implementation, BiFSMN can achieve an impressive 22.3x speedup and 15.5x storage-saving on real-world edge hardware.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0603.pdf"

This approach delivers strong results, particularly for few-shot semantic parsing, which is of key importance in practice and the focus of our paper.

To solve the problem, in this paper, we introduce a fresh perspective to revisit the triple extraction task and propose a simple but effective model, named DirectRel.  Specifically, the proposed model first generates candidate entities through enumerating token sequences in a sentence, and then transforms the triple extraction task into a linking problem on a ``head -> tail"" bipartite graph. By doing so, all triples can be directly extracted in only one step.

Our approach creates diverse parallel GEC data without any language-specific operations by taking the non-autoregressive translation generated by PXLM and the gold translation as error-corrected sentence pairs.

They cannot update indirectly mentioned slots well, either. This study designed a model with a mentioned slot pool (MSP) to tackle the update problem. The MSP is a slot specific memory that records all mentioned slot values that may be inherited, and our model updates slot values according to the MSP and the dialogue context. Our model rejects inheriting the previous slot value when it predicates the value is wrong. Then, it extracts the slot value from the current dialogue context. As the contextual information accumulates, the new value is more likely to be correct. It also can track the indirectly mentioned slot by picking a value from the MSP.

In the propose stage, we use a span-based predictor to generate some coarse entity predictions as entity proposals. In the refine stage, proposals interact with each other, and richer contextual information is incorporated into the proposal representations. The refined proposal representations are used to re-predict entity boundaries and classes. In this way, errors in coarse proposals can be eliminated, and the boundary prediction is no longer constrained by the span enumeration length limitation. Additionally, we build multi-scale sentence representations, which better model the hierarchical structure of sentences and provide richer contextual information than token-level representations. Experiments show that PnRNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on four nested NER datasets and one flat NER dataset.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0613.pdf"

However, concerns are rising over their primitive sensitivity to distribution biases that reside in the training and testing data. This issue hugely impacts the performance of the models when exposed to out-of-distribution and counterfactual data. The root cause seems to be that many machine learning models are prone to learn the shortcuts, modelling simple correlations rather than more fundamental and general relationships. As a result, such text classifiers tend to perform poorly when a human makes minor modifications to the data, which raises questions regarding their robustness. In this paper, we employ a rule-based architecture called Tsetlin Machine (TM) that learns both simple and complex correlations by ANDing features and their negations. As such, it generates explainable AND-rules using negated and non-negated reasoning. Here, we explore how non-negated reasoning can be more prone to distribution biases than negated reasoning. We further leverage this finding by adapting the TM architecture to mainly perform negated reasoning using the specificity parameter s. As a result, the AND-rules becomes robust to spurious correlations and can also correctly predict counterfactual data. Our empirical investigation of the model's robustness uses the specificity s to control the degree of negated reasoning. Experiments on publicly available Counterfactually-Augmented Data demonstrate that the negated clauses are robust to spurious correlations and outperform Naive Bayes, SVM, and Bi-LSTM by up to 20 %, and  ELMo by almost 6 % on counterfactual test data.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0616.pdf"

In this paper, we propose the multilingual translation model with the high-resource language-specific training (HLT-MT) to alleviate the negative interference, which adopts the two-stage training with the language-specific selection mechanism. Specifically, we first train the multilingual model only with the high-resource pairs and select the language-specific modules at the top of the decoder to enhance the translation quality of high-resource directions. Next, the model is further trained on all available corpora to transfer knowledge from high-resource languages (HRLs) to low-resource languages (LRLs).

To this end, we propose SyntaSpeech, a syntax-aware and light-weight NAR-TTS model, which integrates tree-structured syntactic information into the prosody modeling modules in PortaSpeech. Specifically, 1) We build a syntactic graph based on the dependency tree of the input sentence, then process the text encoding with a syntactic graph encoder to extract the syntactic information. 2) We incorporate the extracted syntactic encoding with PortaSpeech to improve the prosody prediction. 3) We introduce a multi-length discriminator to replace the flow-based post-net in PortaSpeech, which simplifies the training pipeline and improves the inference speed, while keeping the naturalness of the generated audio. Experiments on three datasets not only show that the tree-structured syntactic information grants SyntaSpeech the ability to synthesize better audio with expressive prosody, but also demonstrate the generalization ability of SyntaSpeech to adapt to multiple languages and multi-speaker text-to-speech.

Inspired by related pedagogy theories that learning to write can promote comprehension ability, we propose a novel Contrastive Variational Modelling (CVM) framework to exploit the labelled data better. CVM models the conditional distributions of text and clickbait labels by predicting labels from text and generating text from labels simultaneously with Variational AutoEncoder and further differentiates the learned spaces under each label by a mixed contrastive learning loss. In this way, CVM can capture more underlying textual properties and hence utilize label information to its full potential, boosting detection performance.

To convict a person/unit of a charge, the case description must contain matching instances of the constitutive elements (CEs) of that charge. This knowledge of CEs is a valuable guide for the judge in making final decisions. However, it is far from fully exploited for charge prediction in the literature. In this paper we propose a novel method named Constitutive Elements-guided Charge Prediction (CECP). CECP mimics human's charge identification process to extract potential instances of CEs and generate predictions accordingly. It avoids laborious labeling of matching instances of CEs by a novel reinforcement learning module which progressively selects potentially matching sentences for CEs and evaluates their relevance. The final prediction is generated based on the selected sentences and their relevant CEs. Experiments on two real-world datasets show the superiority of CECP over competitive baselines.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0627.pdf"

In a typical document, most entity pairs do not express any pre-defined relation and are labeled as ""none"" or ""no relation"". For good document-level RE performance, it is crucial to distinguish such none class instances (entity pairs) from those of pre-defined classes (relations). However, most existing methods only estimate the probability of pre-defined relations independently without considering the probability of ""no relation"". This ignores the context of entity pairs and the label correlations between the none class and pre-defined classes, leading to sub-optimal predictions. To address this problem, we propose a new multi-label loss that encourages large margins of label confidence scores between each pre-defined class and the none class, which enables captured label correlations and context-dependent thresholding for label prediction. To gain further robustness against positive-negative imbalance and mislabeled data that could appear in real-world RE datasets, we propose a margin regularization and a margin shifting technique. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing multi-label losses for document-level RE and works well in other multi-label tasks such as emotion classification when none class instances are available for training.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0630.pdf"

In addition, the correlations among traits should be considered since they are important psychological cues that could help collectively identify the traits. In this paper, we construct a fully-connected post graph for each user and develop a novel Contrastive Graph Transformer Network model (CGTN) which distills potential labels of the graphs based on both labeled and unlabeled data.

We design two types of post graph augmentations to incorporate different priors based on psycholinguistic knowledge of Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) and post semantics.

We observe that this problem corresponds to a reachability problem in model-checking, but that state-of-the-art model checkers struggle to find concrete trajectories. To overcome this issue we provide a formal mapping from HA to PDDL+ and show how to use an off-the-shelf automated planner.

In this context, a natural form of explanation for a soft-goal conflict is a minimal constraint relaxation under which the conflict disappears (``if the deadline was 1 hour later, it would work''). We explore algorithms for computing such explanations. A baseline is to simply loop over all relaxed tasks and compute the conflicts for each separately. We improve over this by two algorithms that leverage information -- conflicts, reachable states -- across relaxed tasks. We show that these algorithms can exponentially outperform the baseline in theory, and we run experiments confirming that advantage in practice.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0641.pdf"

Given  the  original  simulator  of  the  environment, which may be computationally very demanding, we propose to learn online an approximate but much faster simulator that improves over time.  To plan reliably and efficiently while the approximate simulator is learning, we develop a method that adaptively decides which simulator to use for every simulation, based on a statistic that measures the accuracy of the approximate simulator. This allows us to use the approximate simulator to replace the original simulator for faster simulations when it is accurate enough under the current context, thus trading off  simulation speed  and  accuracy.

Then, an online version of this problem is introduced to meet the need of online and irrevocable decision making when those parameters are revealed in an online fashion. To achieve a far-sighted emergency relief planning under attacks, we design an online learning approach which is proven to obtain a near-optimal solution of the offline problem when those online reveled parameters are i.i.d. sampled from an unknown distribution.

Theoretical results in a simplified setting give conditions under which PG3 is optimal or admissible.

Moreover, we introduce a pruning strategy based on termination tests on subgraphs.

Previous studies usually assumed that the robots must complete all tasks with minimum time cost. However, in many real situations, some tasks can be selectively performed by robots and will not limit the achievement of the goal. Instead, completing these tasks will cause some functional effects, such as decreasing the time cost of completing other tasks. This kind of task can be called “functional task”. This paper studies the multi-robot task allocation in the environment with functional tasks. In the problem, neither allocating all functional tasks nor allocating no functional task is always optimal. Previous algorithms usually allocate all tasks and cannot suitably select the functional tasks. Because of the interaction and sequential influence, the total effects of the functional tasks are too complex to exactly calculate. We fully analyze this problem and then design a heuristic algorithm. The heuristic algorithm scores the functional tasks referring to linear threshold model (used to analyze the sequential influence of a functional task). The simulated experiments demonstrate that the heuristic algorithm can outperform the benchmark algorithms.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0653.pdf"

Then, two dual processes in RL-Enhanced Interaction Learning generate reward feedback for each other and collectively enhance obstacle avoidance capability.

This paper considers robust subset selection with monotone objective functions, relaxing the submodular property required by previous studies. We first show that the greedy algorithm can obtain an approximation ratio with respect to the correlation and submodularity ratios of the objective functions; and then propose EPORSS, an evolutionary Pareto optimization algorithm that can utilize more time to find better subsets. We prove that EPORSS can also be theoretically grounded, achieving a similar approximation guarantee to the greedy algorithm.

Non-uniform costs on items significantly increase the solution complexity and we prove that BSSM is NP-hard. To solve the problem, we first propose a greedy algorithm GBM with an error bound. We also design an anytime algorithm POBM based on Pareto optimization to improve the quality of solutions. Moreover, we prove that POBM can obtain approximate solutions in expected polynomial running time, and converges faster than a state-of-the-art algorithm POSEQSEL for sequence submodular maximization with cardinality constraints. We further introduce optimizations to speed up POBM. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of our new algorithms.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0656.pdf"

In this paper we consider a version of RTHS in which temporally extended goals can be defined on the form of the path. Such goals are specified in Linear Temporal Logic over Finite Traces (LTLf), an expressive language that has been considered in many other frameworks, such as Automated Planning, Synthesis, and Reinforcement Learning, but has not yet been studied in the context of RTHS. We propose a general automata-theoretic approach for RTHS, whereby LTLf goals are supported as the result of searching over the cross product of the search graph and the automaton for the LTLf goal; specifically, we describe LTL-LRTA*, a version of LSS-LRTA*. Second, we propose an approach to produce heuristics for LTLf goals, based on existing goal-dependent heuristics. Finally, we propose a greedy strategy for RTHS with LTLf goals, which focuses search to make progress over the structure of the automaton; this yields LTL-LRTA*+A.

We therefore introduce a multi-objective formulation of the problem which trades off the expected cost and its variance. We show that multi-objective evolutionary algorithms are highly effective when using this formulation and obtain a set of solutions that contains an optimal solution for any possible confidence level imposed on the constraint. Furthermore, we prove that this approach can also be used to compute a set of optimal solutions for the chance constrained minimum spanning tree problem.

Among them, the reference center is the closest center to a client and serves it under normal circumstances, while the backup center is the closest center to the reference center and serves the client when the reference center is out of service.

Instrumental variables (IVs) are widely used for causal effect estimation when there exist latent confounders. With the standard IV method, when a given IV is valid, unbiased estimation can be obtained, but the validity requirement on a standard IV is strict and untestable. Conditional IVs have been proposed to relax the requirement of standard IVs by conditioning on a set of observed variables (known as a conditioning set for a conditional IV). However, the criterion for finding a conditioning set for a conditional IV needs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the causal relationships of both observed and unobserved variables. This makes it challenging to discover a conditioning set directly from data. In this paper, by leveraging maximal ancestral graphs (MAGs) for causal inference with latent variables, we study the graphical properties of ancestral IVs, a type of conditional IVs using MAGs, and develop the theory to support data-driven discovery of the conditioning set for a given ancestral IV in data under the pretreatment variable assumption. Based on the theory, we develop an algorithm for unbiased causal effect estimation with a given ancestral IV and observational data. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the performance of the algorithm in comparison with existing IV methods.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0671.pdf"

PCFGs are more expressive than HMMs, e.g., they are more suited for studying protein folding or natural language processing. However, they suffer from slow parameter fitting, which is cubic in the observation sequence length. The same process for HMMs is just linear using the well-known forward-backward algorithm. We argue that by adding to each state of an HMM an integer counter, e.g., representing the number of clients waiting in a queue, brings its expressivity closer to PCFGs. At the same time, we show that parameter fitting for such a model is computationally inexpensive: it is bi-linear in the length of the observation sequence and the maximal counter value, which grows slower than the observation length. The resulting model of H1MMs allows us to combine the best of both worlds: more expressivity with faster parameter fitting.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0673.pdf"

Exchangeability, which arises naturally in relational domains, has not been considered for efficient representation and inference in SPNs yet.The contribution of this paper is a novel probabilistic model which we call Exchangeability-Aware Sum-Product Networks (XSPNs). It contains both SPNs and MEVMs as special cases, and combines the ability of SPNs to efficiently learn deep probabilistic models with the ability of MEVMs to efficiently handle exchangeable random variables.

Building upon recent development in cluster causal diagrams (C-DAGs), we initiate the formal study of learning C-DAGs from observational data to relax the faithfulness condition. We propose a new scoring function, the Clustering Information Criterion (CIC), based on information-theoretic measures that represent various complex interactions among variables. The CIC score also contains a penalization of the model complexity under the minimum description length principle. We further provide a searching strategy to learn structures of high scores.

Thus, besides individual actions' reward, learning the causal relations is essential to improve the decision-making strategy. To solve the two-fold learning problem described above, we develop the 'combinatorial semi-bandit framework with causally related rewards', where we model the causal relations by a directed graph in a stationary structural equation model. The nodal observation in the graph signal comprises the corresponding base arm's instantaneous reward and an additional term resulting from the causal influences of other base arms' rewards. The objective is to maximize the long-term average payoff, which is a linear function of the base arms' rewards and depends strongly on the network topology. To achieve this objective, we propose a policy that determines the causal relations by learning the network's topology and simultaneously exploits this knowledge to optimize the decision-making process. We establish a sublinear regret bound for the proposed algorithm.

In particular, we address the maximum marginal probability (MARmax) problem, that is, determining the greatest probability of an event (such as misclassification) obtainable for parameters in the credal set. We develop a method to faithfully transfer the problem into a constrained optimization problem on a probabilistic circuit. By performing a simple constraint relaxation, we show how to obtain a guaranteed upper bound on MARmax in linear time in the size of the circuit. We further theoretically characterize this constraint relaxation in terms of the original Bayesian network structure, which yields insight into the tightness of the bound.

As we see the emergence of generative models directed toward creativity research, a need for machine learning-based surrogate metrics to characterize creative output from these models is imperative. We propose group-based subset scanning to identify, quantify,  and characterize creative processes by detecting a subset of anomalous node-activations in the hidden layers of the generative models. Our experiments on the standard image benchmarks and their ``creatively generated'' variants reveal that the proposed subset scores distribution is more useful for detecting novelty in creative processes in the activation space rather than the pixel space. Further, we found that creative samples generate larger subsets of anomalies than normal or non-creative samples across datasets. The node activations highlighted during the creative decoding process are different from those responsible for the normal sample generation. Lastly, we assess if the images from the subsets selected by our method were also found creative by human evaluators, presenting a link between creativity perception in humans and node activations within deep neural nets.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0683.pdf"

The goal of this work is to reduce the authoring burden for creating sifting queries.

These networks allow for the fortunes between any two characters to be plotted against time as a story arc. Similarity scores between story arcs from the simulation and a user’s query arc can be calculated using the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm. Events corresponding to the story arc that best matches the query arc can then be returned to the user, thus providing an intuitive means for users to sift a variety of stories without coding a search query. These components are implemented in our experimental prototype ARC SIFT. The results of a user study support our expectation that ARC SIFT is an intuitive and accurate tool that allows human users to sift stories out from a larger chronicle of events emerging from a simulated story world.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0686.pdf"

Inspired by a theory in art that style and content are generally inseparable during the creative process, we propose a coupled approach, known here as StyleCLIPDraw, whereby the drawing is generated by optimizing for style and content simultaneously throughout the process as opposed to applying style transfer after creating content in a sequence. Based on human evaluation, the styles of images generated by StyleCLIPDraw are strongly preferred to those by the sequential approach. Although the quality of content generation degrades for certain styles, overall considering both content and style, StyleCLIPDraw is found far more preferred, indicating the importance of style, look, and feel of machine generated images to people as well as indicating that style is coupled in the drawing process itself.

In this paper, we propose a Music-to-Dance with Optimal Transport Network (MDOT-Net) for learning to generate 3D dance choreographies from music. We introduce an optimal transport distance for evaluating the authenticity of the generated dance distribution and a Gromov-Wasserstein distance to measure the correspondence between the dance distribution and the input music. This gives a well defined and non-divergent training objective that mitigates the limitation of standard GAN training which is frequently plagued with instability and divergent generator loss issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our MDOT-Net can synthesize realistic and diverse dances which achieve an organic unity with the input music, reflecting the shared intentionality and matching the rhythmic articulation.

We note that image compositions, which contain not only global semantics but also spatial information, would largely affect layout results. Hence, we propose a deep generative model, dubbed as composition-aware graphic layout GAN (CGL-GAN), to synthesize layouts based on the global and spatial visual contents of input images. To obtain training images from images that already contain manually designed graphic layout data, previous work suggests masking design elements (e.g., texts and embellishments) as model inputs, which inevitably leaves hint of the ground truth. We study the misalignment between the training inputs (with hint masks) and test inputs (without masks), and design a novel domain alignment module (DAM) to narrow this gap. For training, we built a large-scale layout dataset which consists of 60,548 advertising posters with annotated layout information. To evaluate the generated layouts, we propose three novel metrics according to aesthetic intuitions. Through both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed model can synthesize high-quality graphic layouts according to image compositions.

Recent studies have shown the potential of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for producing artistically rich stylizations. Despite the promising results, they usually fail to control the generated images' style degree, which is inflexible and limits their applicability for practical use. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose a novel method that for the first time allows adjusting the style degree for existing GAN-based artistic style transfer frameworks in real time after training. Our method introduces two novel modules into existing GAN-based artistic style transfer frameworks: a Style Scaling Injection (SSI) module and a Style Degree Interpretation (SDI) module. The SSI module accepts the value of Style Degree Factor (SDF)  as the input and outputs parameters that scale the feature activations in existing models, offering control signals to alter the style degrees of the stylizations.  And the SDI module interprets the output probabilities of a multi-scale content-style binary classifier as the style degrees, providing a mechanism to parameterize the style degree of the stylizations. Moreover, we show that after training our method can enable existing GAN-based frameworks to produce over-stylizations. The proposed method can facilitate many existing GAN-based artistic style transfer frameworks with marginal extra training overheads and modifications. Extensive qualitative evaluations on two typical GAN-based style transfer models demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for gaining style degree control for them.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0693.pdf"

Measuring pollution levels requires significant investment in reliable and durable instrumentation and subsequent maintenance. On the other hand, there have been many attempts by researchers to develop image-based pollution measurement models which have shown significant results and established the feasibility of the idea. But, taking image-level models to a city-level system presents new challenges, which include scarcity of high-quality annotated data and a high amount of label noise. In this paper, we present a low-cost, end-to-end system for learning pollution maps using images captured through a mobile phone. We demonstrate our system for parts of New Delhi and Ghaziabad. We use transfer learning to overcome the problem of data scarcity. We investigate the effects of label noise in detail and introduce the metric of in-interval accuracy to evaluate our models in presence of noise. We use distributed averaging to learn pollution maps and mitigate the effects of noise to some extent. We also develop haze-based interpretable models which have comparable performance to mainstream models. With only 382 images from Delhi and Ghaziabad and single-scene dataset from Beijing and Shanghai, we are able to achieve a mean absolute error of 44 ug/m^3 in PM2.5 concentration on a test set of 267 images and an in-interval accuracy of 67% on predictions. Going further, we learn pollution maps with a mean absolute error as low as 35 ug/m^3 and in-interval accuracy as high as 74% significantly mitigating the image models' error.

Its importance in determining the health and living standards in urban settings is only expected to increase with time. Various factors ranging from artificial emissions to natural phenomena are known to be primary causal agents or influencers behind rising air pollution levels. However, the lack of large scale data involving the major artificial and natural factors has hindered the research on the causes and relations governing the variability of the different air pollutants. Through this work, we introduce a large scale city-wise dataset for exploring the relationships among these agents over a long period of time. We also introduce a transformer based model - cosSquareFormer, for the problem of pollutant level estimation and forecasting. Our model outperforms most of the benchmark models for this task. We also analyze and explore the dataset through our model and other methodologies to bring out important inferences which enable us to understand the dynamics of the casual agents at a deeper level.

An AI system that is able to personalize theprediction of individual patient lab test responseswill enable clinicians to titrate the medications toachieve the desired therapeutic outcome.  Accurate prediction of lab test response is a challenge because these patients typically have co-morbidities and their treatments might influence the target lab test response. To address this,we model the complex interactions among different medications, diseases, lab test response, andfine-grained dosage information to learn a strongpatient representation. Together with informationfrom similar patients and external knowledge suchas drug-lab interactions and diagnosis-lab interaction, we design a system called KALP to performpersonalized prediction of patients’ response for atarget lab result and identify the top influencingfactors for the prediction.

We propose the first decision-support tool for kidney exchange that takes as input the biological features of a patient-donor pair, and returns (i) the probability of being matched prior to expiry, and (conditioned on a match outcome), (ii) the waiting time for and (iii) the organ quality of the matched transplant.  This information may be used to inform medical and insurance decisions. We predict all quantities (i, ii, iii) exclusively from match records that are readily available in any kidney exchange using a quantile random forest approach. To evaluate our approach, we developed two state-of-the-art realistic simulators based on data from the United Network for Organ Sharing that sample from the training and test distribution for these learning tasks---in our application these distributions are distinct. We analyze distributional shift through a theoretical lens, and show that the two distributions converge as the kidney exchange nears steady-state. We then show that our approach produces clinically-promising estimates using simulated data.

Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) provides a promising way to directly measure plant productivity from space. However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution, making it impossible to monitor how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression (or downscaling) task; at training time, we only have SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3km), but we want to predict SIF at much finer spatial resolutions (e.g. 30m, a 100x increase). We also have additional fine-resolution input features, but the relationship between these features and SIF is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Smooth U-Net (CS-SUNet), a novel method for this coarse supervision setting. CS-SUNet combines the expressive power of deep convolutional networks with novel regularization methods based on prior knowledge (such as a smoothness loss) that are crucial for preventing overfitting.

The proposed solution computes the Shapley value of a factor, i.e., its average contribution to the prediction in different coalitions based on coalitional game theory. Aiming to evaluate the interpretability quality of our solution, experiments are conducted on a Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) questionnaire dataset.

An additional challenge is the restricted exchange of information: where the consumers do not have access to network information and the network operator does not have access  to consumer load parameters. We propose a distributed framework which generates an optimal EV charging schedule for individual residential consumers based on their preferences and iteratively updates it until the network reliability constraints set by the operator are satisfied. We validate the proposed approach for different EV adoption levels in a synthetically created digital twin of an actual power distribution network. The results demonstrate that the new approach can achieve a higher level of network reliability compared to the case where residential consumers charge EVs based solely on their individual preferences, thus providing a solution for the existing grid to keep up with increased adoption rates without significant investments in increasing grid capacity.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0710.pdf"

We propose Work4Food, which provides income guarantees to delivery agents, while minimizing platform costs and ensuring customer satisfaction. Work4Food ensures that the income guarantees are met in such a way that it does not lead to increased working hours or degrade environmental impact. To incorporate these objectives, Work4Food balances supply and demand by controlling the number of agents in the system and providing dynamic payment guarantees to agents based on factors such as agent location, ratings, etc. We evaluate Work4Food on a real-world dataset from a leading food delivery platform and establish its advantages over the state of the art in terms of the multi-dimensional objectives at hand.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0711.pdf"

In particular, the mathematical-programming based approaches need to solve the Linear Program (LP) relaxation of the problem using an LP solver, which restricts the scalability of this approach. In this work, we overcome this restriction by designing an algorithm that adapts the multiplicative weights update (MWU) framework, along with the sample average approximation (SAA) technique, to approximately solve the linear program (LP) relaxation for the problem. To scale this approach further, we provide a memory-efficient algorithm that enables scaling to large networks, corresponding to country-size populations, with over 300 million nodes and 30  billion edges.

Current quantitative causal models rely on one or more assumptions: (1) the climate drivers persistently generate conflict, (2) the causal mechanisms have a linear relationship with the conflict generation parameter, and/or (3) there is sufficient data to inform the prior distribution. Yet, we know conflict drivers often excite a social transformation process which leads to violence (e.g., drought forces agricultural producers to join urban militia), but further climate effects do not necessarily contribute to further violence. Therefore, not only is this bifurcation relationship highly non-linear, there is also often a lack of data to support prior assumptions for high resolution modeling. Here, we aim to overcome the aforementioned causal modeling challenges by proposing a neural forward-intensity Poisson process (NFIPP) model. The NFIPP is designed to capture the potential non-linear causal mechanism in climate induced political violence, whilst being robust to sparse and timing-uncertain data. Our results span 20 recent years and reveal an excitation-based causal link between extreme climate events and political violence across diverse countries. Our climate-induced conflict model results are cross-validated against qualitative climate vulnerability indices. Furthermore, we label historical events that either improve or reduce our predictability gain, demonstrating the importance of domain expertise in informing interpretation.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0718.pdf"

To assess the framework’s performance, experiments were conducted on ten synthetic datasets (N>33,000) generated from HiRID - a real-world Intensive Care Unit (ICU) dataset, showing its ability to accurately detect and quantify inequality proportionally to controlled inequalities. Extensive analyses were carried out to quantify health inequalities (a) embedded in two real-world ICU datasets; (b) induced by AI models trained for two resource allocation scenarios. Results showed that compared to men, women had up to 33% poorer deterioration in markers of prognosis when admitted to HiRID ICUs.

The difficulty of this problem lies in the fact that the payoff of vaccination cannot be directly observed, making it difficult to compare the relative effectiveness of vaccination on different population groups. Currently used vaccination policies make recommendations based on mathematical modelling and ethical considerations. These policies are static, and do not adapt as conditions change. Our aim is to design and evaluate an algorithm which can make use of routine surveillance data to dynamically adjust its recommendation. We evaluate the performance of our approach by applying it to a simulated epidemic of a disease based on real-world COVID-19 data, and show that our vaccination policy was able to perform better than existing vaccine allocation policies.In particular, we show that with our allocation method, we can reduce the number of required vaccination by at least 50% in order to keep the peak number of hospitalised patients below a certain threshold. Also, when the same batch sizes are used, our method can reduce the peak number of hospitalisation by up to 20%.We also demonstrate that our vaccine allocation does not vary the number of batches per group much, making it socially more acceptable (as it reduces uncertainty, hence results in better and more interpretable communication).","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0722.pdf"

When some species are more vulnerable, we ought to offer more protection to these animals; unfortunately, existing combinatorial bandit approaches do not offer a way to prioritize important species. To bridge this gap, (1) We propose a novel combinatorial bandit objective that trades off between reward maximization and also accounts for prioritization over species, which we call ranked prioritization.

(3) We demonstrate empirically that RankedCUCB leads to up to 38% improvement in outcomes for endangered species using real-world wildlife conservation data. Along with adapting to other challenges such as preventing illegal logging and overfishing, our no-regret algorithm addresses the general combinatorial bandit problem with a weighted linear objective.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0723.pdf"

From this large, unlabeled pool of interruptions, we release an annotated dataset consisting of 2,000 dialogues with fine-grained interruption labels. We use this dataset to train an interruption classifier and predict the interruption type of a given dialogue. Our results reveal that male speakers (in our collected samples) tend to talk more than female speakers, while female speakers interrupt more. Moreover, people tend to use less intrusive interruptions when talking to others sharing the same political belief.

A Hierarchical Attentional Network equipped with BERT (HAN-BERT) is proposed to further advance explainable predictions. For ERD, we propose an online algorithm based on an evolving queue of risky posts that can significantly reduce the number of model inferences to boost efficiency.

Online tools that offer students the possibility to manually create or automatically extract concept maps from text have been created over the years. However, there is still a shortage of software that are specifically designed for children at risk and which produce a concept map that is tailored to the clinical profiles of individuals. In this Project Collaboration, we want to tackle this gap by implementing a multi-modal, online and open-access Artificial-Intelligence powered tool that could help these children to make sense of written text by enabling them to interactively create concept maps.

ELPs thus deliver multiple collections of answer sets, known as world views. Employing ELPs for reasoning problems so far has mainly been restricted to standard deci- sion problems (complexity analysis) and enumeration (development of systems) of world views. In this paper, we first establish quantitative reasoning for ELPs, where the acceptance of a certain set of literals depends on the number (proportion) of world views that are compatible with the set. Second, we present a novel system capable of efficiently solving the underlying counting problems required for quantitative reasoning.

More importantly, the local search assignments and the conflict frequency of variables in local search are exploited in the phase selection and branching heuristics of CDCL. We use our techniques to improve three typical CDCL solvers (glucose, MapleLCMDistChronoBT and Kissat).

We show how optimal allocations in our model arise as solutions to continuous optimization problems over multiple generations, and we find in general that these optimal solutions can favor recipients of low socioeconomic status over slightly higher-performing individuals of high socioeconomic status --- a form of socioeconomic affirmative action that the society in our model discovers in the pursuit of purely payoff-maximizing goals.

Previous works show results along the lines of “EM converges at least as fast as gradient descent” by assuming the conditions for the convergence of gradient descent apply. This approach is not only loose, in that it does not capture that EM can make more progress than a gradient step, but the assumptions fail to hold for textbook examples of EM like Gaussian mixtures. In this work, we show that for the common setting of exponential family distributions, viewing EM as a mirror descent algorithm leads to convergence rates in Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and how the KL divergence is related to first-order stationarity via Bregman divergences. In contrast to previous works, the analysis is invariant to the choice of parametrization and holds with minimal assumptions. We also show applications of these ideas to local linear (and superlinear) convergence rates, generalized EM, and non-exponential family distributions.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0738.pdf"

We translate each query into an end-to-end differentiable objective, where the truth value of each atom is computed by a pre-trained neural link predictor. We then analyse two solutions to the optimisation problem, including gradient-based and combinatorial search. In our experiments, the proposed approach produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods — black-box models trained on millions of generated queries — without the need for training on a large and diverse set of complex queries. Using orders of magnitude less training data, we obtain relative improvements ranging from 8% up to 40% in Hits@3 across multiple knowledge graphs. We find that it is possible to explain the outcome of our model in terms of the intermediate solutions identified for each of the complex query atoms.

If successful, web-based mental health conversations could improve access to treatment and reduce the global disease burden. Psychologists have repeatedly demonstrated that empathy, the ability to understand and feel the emotions and experiences of others, is a key component leading to positive outcomes in supportive conversations. However, recent studies have shown that highly empathic conversations are rare in online mental health platforms. In this paper, we work towards improving empathy in online mental health support conversations. We introduce a new task of empathic rewriting which aims to transform low-empathy conversational posts to higher empathy. Learning such transformations is challenging and requires a deep understanding of empathy while maintaining conversation quality through text fluency and specificity to the conversational context. Here we propose Partner, a deep reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to make sentence-level edits to posts in order to increase the expressed level of empathy while maintaining conversation quality. Our RL agent leverages a policy network, based on a transformer language model adapted from GPT-2, which performs the dual task of generating candidate empathic sentences and adding those sentences at appropriate positions. Through a combination of automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that Partner successfully generates more empathic, specific, and diverse responses and outperforms NLP methods from related tasks such as style transfer and empathic dialogue generation.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0747.pdf"

Unfortunately, current prototyping tools assume a black-box view of AI, forcing designers to work with separate tools to explore machine learning models, understand model performance, and align interface choices with model behavior. This introduces friction to rapid and iterative prototyping. We propose Model-Informed Prototyping (MIP), a workflow for AIX design that combines model exploration with UI prototyping tasks.

Recent studies targeting this difficult problem either require a known space-partitioning as the input, or can only support limited special cases (e.g., binary classification). Moreover, heterogeneity-pattern learned by these methods are locked to the locations of the training samples, and cannot be applied to new locations. We propose a statistically-guided framework to adaptively partition data in space during training using distribution-driven optimization and transform a deep learning model (of user's choice) into a heterogeneity-aware architecture.

Experiment results on real-world datasets show that the framework can effectively capture footprints of heterogeneity and substantially improve prediction performances.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0752.pdf"

Since signed languages exhibit all the fundamental linguistic properties of natural language, we believe that tools and theories of Natural Language Processing (NLP) are crucial towards its modeling. However, existing research in Sign Language Processing (SLP) seldom attempt to explore and leverage the linguistic organization of signed languages. This position paper calls on the NLP community to include signed languages as a research area with high social and scientific impact. We first discuss the linguistic properties of signed languages to consider during their modeling. Then, we review the limitations of current SLP models and identify the open challenges to extend NLP to signed languages. Finally, we urge (1) the adoption of an efficient tokenization method; (2) the development of linguistically-informed models; (3) the collection of real-world signed language data;  (4) the inclusion of local signed language communities as an active and leading voice in research.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0753.pdf"

However, the efficiency of most existing DR models is limited by the large memory cost of storing dense vectors and the time-consuming nearest neighbor search (NNS) in vector space. Therefore, we present RepCONC, a novel retrieval model that learns discrete Representations via CONstrained Clustering. RepCONC jointly trains dual-encoders and the Product Quantization (PQ) method to learn discrete document representations and enables fast approximate NNS with compact indexes. It models quantization as a constrained clustering process, which requires the document embeddings to be uniformly clustered around the quantization centroids. We theoretically demonstrate the importance of the uniform clustering constraint and derive an efficient approximate solution for constrained clustering by reducing it to an instance of the optimal transport problem. Extensive experiments on two popular ad-hoc retrieval benchmarks show that RepCONC substantially outperforms a wide range of existing retrieval models in terms of retrieval effectiveness, memory efficiency, and time efficiency.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0754.pdf"

In this paper, we propose a novel model RxNet, which builds 1) a dynamic heterogeneous graph to model Rx refills that are essentially prescribing and dispensing (P&D) relationships among various patients, 2) an RxLSTM network to explore the dynamic Rx-refill behavior and medical condition variation of patients, and 3) a dosing-adaptive network to extract and recalibrate dosing patterns and obtain the refined patient representations which are finally utilized for overprescribing detection.

However, it requires sequential backwards updates and non-local computations which make it challenging to parallelize at scale and is unlike how learning works in the brain.

While predictive coding originated in theoretical neuroscience as a model of information processing in the cortex, recent work has developed the idea into a general-purpose algorithm  able to train neural networks using only local computations. In this survey, we review works that have contributed to this perspective and demonstrate the close connection between predictive coding and backpropagation in terms of generalization quality, as well as works that highlight the multiple advantages of using predictive coding models over backprop-trained neural networks. Specifically, we show the substantially greater flexibility of  predictive coding networks against equivalent deep neural networks, which can function as classifiers, generators, and associative memories simultaneously, and can be defined on arbitrary graph topologies. Finally, we  review direct benchmarks of predictive coding networks on machine learning classification tasks, as well as its close connections to control theory and applications in robotics.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0774.pdf"

Based on a systematic analysis of recent literature, we first propose a new typology of harmful memes, and then we highlight and summarize the relevant state of the art. One interesting finding is that many types of harmful memes are not really studied, e.g., such featuring self-harm and extremism, partly due to the lack of suitable datasets. We further find that existing datasets mostly capture multi-class scenarios, which are not inclusive of the affective spectrum that memes can represent. Another observation is that memes can propagate globally through repackaging in different languages and that they can also be multilingual, blending different cultures. We conclude by highlighting several challenges related to multimodal semiotics, technological constraints, and non-trivial social engagement, and we present several open-ended aspects such as delineating online harm and empirically examining related frameworks and assistive interventions, which we believe will motivate and drive future research.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0781.pdf"

The task in the standard MAPF is to find discrete paths through which agents can navigate from their starting positions to individual goal positions. The combination of two additional requirements makes the problem computationally challenging: agents must not collide with each other and the paths must be optimal with respect to some objective. Two major approaches to optimal MAPF solving include dedicated search-based methods, and compilation-based methods that reduce a MAPF instance to an instance in a different formalism, for which an efficient solver exists.  In this survey, we summarize major compilation-based solvers for MAPF using CSP, SAT, and MILP formalisms. We explain the core ideas of the solvers in a simplified and unified way while preserving the merit making them more accessible for a wider audience.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0783.pdf"

However, most existing studies assume that the seller knows the entire distribution from which the players’ values are drawn. Unfortunately, this assumption may not hold in reality: for example, when the distributions have exponentially large supports or do not have succinct representations. In this work we consider, for the first time, the query complexityof Bayesian mechanisms. The seller only has limited oracle accesses to the players’ distributions, via quantile queriesand value queries. For single-item auctions, we design mechanisms with logarithmicnumber of value or quantile queries which achieve almost optimal revenue. We then prove logarithmic lower-bounds, i.e., logarithmic number of queries are necessary for any constant approximation DSIC mechanisms, even when randomized and adaptive queries are allowed. Thus our mechanisms are almost optimal regarding query complexity. Our lower-bounds can be extended to multi-item auctions with monotone subadditive valuations, and we complement this part with constant approximation mechanisms for unit-demand or additive valuation functions. Our results are robust even if the answers to the queries contain noises.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0795.pdf"

Literal quantification is more fine-grained than variable quantification, which leads to a refinement of quantified Boolean logic with literal quantification as its primitive.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0797.pdf"

To decide whether to bid for a previously unseen product, a facility must be able to synthesize, on the fly, a process plan controller that delegates abstract manufacturing tasks in a supplied process recipe to the available manufacturing resources. First-order representations of the state are commonly considered in reasoning about action in AI. Here we show that we can leverage the wide literature on the Situation Calculus automatically synthesize such controllers. We identify two important decidable cases---finite domains and bounded action theories---for which we provide practical synthesis techniques.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0798.pdf"

One approach to this problem is to cast it as an apperception task. Here, the task is to construct an explicit interpretable theory that both explains the sensory sequence and also satisfies a set of  unity conditions, designed to ensure that the constituents of the theory are connected in a relational structure. However, the original formulation of the apperception task had one fundamental limitation: it assumed the raw sensory input had already been parsed using a set of discrete categories, so that all the system had to do was receive this already-digested symbolic input, and make sense of it. But what if we don't have access to pre-parsed input? What if our sensory sequence is raw unprocessed information?The central contribution of this paper is a neuro-symbolic framework for distilling interpretable theories out of streams of raw, unprocessed sensory experience.First, we extend the definition of the apperception task to include ambiguous (but still symbolic) input: sequences of sets of disjunctions. Next, we use a neural network to map raw sensory input to disjunctive input. Our binary neural network is encoded as a logic program, so the weights of the network and the rules of the theory can be solved jointly as a single SAT problem. This way, we are able to jointly learn how to perceive (mapping raw sensory information to concepts) and apperceive (combining concepts into declarative rules).","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0799.pdf"

For example, replacing an object in a pick-and-place task affects where the robot should target its actions, but does not necessarily affect the underlying action model. In contrast, replacing a tool that the robot will use to complete a task will effectively alter its end-effector pose with respect to the robot's base coordinate system, and thus the robot's motion must be replanned accordingly. These examples highlight the relationship among (i) differences between the source and target environments, (ii) the level of abstraction at which a robot's task model should be represented to enable transfer to the target environment, and (iii) the information needed to ground the abstracted task representation in the target environment. In this abstract, summarizing our full article [Fitzgerald et al., 2021], we present our taxonomy of transfer problems based on this relationship. We also describe a knowledge representation called the Tiered Task Abstraction (TTA) and demonstrate its applicability to a variety of transfer problems in the taxonomy. Our experimental results indicate a trade-off between the generality and data requirements of a task representation, and reinforce the need for multiple transfer methods that operate at different levels of abstraction.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0800.pdf"

Thus, there exists a plethora of anomaly detection methods which increases every year for a wide variety of domains.

Current literature is focused on creating new anomaly detection methods or large frameworks for experimenting with multiple methods at the same time. However, and especially as the literature continues to expand, an extensive evaluation of every anomaly detection method is simply not feasible. To reduce this evaluation burden, we present guidelines to intelligently choose the optimal anomaly detection methods based on the characteristics the time series displays such as seasonality, trend, level change concept drift, and missing time steps. We provide a comprehensive experimental validation and survey of twelve anomaly detection methods over different time series characteristics to form guidelines based on several metrics: the AUC (Area Under the Curve), windowed F-score, and Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) scoring model. Applying our methodologies can save time and effort by surfacing the most promising anomaly detection methods instead of experimenting extensively with a rapidly expanding library of anomaly detection methods, especially in an online setting.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0801.pdf"

We then analyze their behavior w.r.t. common postulates defined for classical propositional knowledge bases, and find that the latter are not suitable for spatio-temporal databases, in that the proposed inconsistency measures do not often satisfy them. In light of this, we argue that also postulates should explicitly take into account the spatial, temporal, and object dimensions, and thus define ``dimension-aware'' counterparts of common postulates, which are indeed often satisfied by the new inconsistency measures.

Using similar concepts for explanation is argued to help with comprehensibility, since the concepts are familiar.

Some methods assume either a fully cooperative or a zero-sum setting; these assumptions entail that the human's goals are either identical to that of the agent, or their opposite. In both cases, the agent is not required to explicitly model the human’s goals and account for humans' adaptation nature. Other methods first compose a model of human behavior based on observing human actions, and then optimize the agent’s actions based on this model. Such methods do not account for how the human will react to the agent's actions and thus, suffer an overestimation bias.Finally, other methods, such as model free reinforcement learning, merely learn which actions the agent should take at which states. While such methods can, theoretically, account for human adaptation nature, since they require extensive interaction with humans, they usually run in simulation.By not considering the human’s goals, autonomous agents act selfishly, lack generalization, require vast amounts of data, and cannot account for human’s strategic behavior. Therefore, we call for pursuing solution concepts for autonomous agents interacting with humans that consider the human’s goals and adaptive nature.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0813.pdf"

This helps to form larger games in auctions, coalitional games, matching etc., which is not achievable with the traditional solutions. The challenge is that the participants are competitors and they would not invite each other by default. Solving this is well-coupled with the existing challenges. For example, in auctions, solving it may require revenue monotonicity and false-name-proofness, which were proved impossible to achieve under certain sensible conditions. In matching, this cannot get along with standard optimality and stability.

In this paper, we design a practical VM scheduling platform, i.e., VMAgent, to assist researchers in developing their methods on the VM scheduling problem. VMAgent consists of three components: simulator, scheduler, and visualizer. The simulator abstracts three general realistic scheduling scenarios (fading, recovering, and expansion) based on Huawei Cloud’s scheduling data, which is the core of our platform. Flexible configurations are further provided to make the simulator compatible with practical cloud computing architecture (i.e., Multi Non-Uniform Memory Access) and scenarios. Researchers then need to instantiate the scheduler to interact with the simulator, which is also pre-built in various types (e.g., heuristic, machine learning, and operations research) of scheduling algorithms to speed up the algorithm design. The visualizer, as an auxiliary component of the simulator and scheduler, facilitates researchers to conduct an in-depth analysis of the scheduling procedure and comprehensively compare different scheduling algorithms.

The users can interactively modify the projected coordinates of inputs on the workspace using our designed tools, then the modified information will be fed back to the network to fine-tune it, which in turn affects the network's classification results, thereby improving the accuracy of network classification.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0861.pdf"

However, developing an effective action recognition solution often requires extensive engineering efforts in building and testing different combinations of the modules and their hyperparameters. In this demo, we present AutoVideo, a Python system for automated video action recognition. AutoVideo is featured for 1) highly modular and extendable infrastructure following the standard pipeline language, 2) an exhaustive list of primitives for pipeline construction, 3) data-driven tuners to save the efforts of pipeline tuning, and 4) easy-to-use Graphical User Interface (GUI).

In this work, we present a production-ready text/speech-driven full-body animation synthesis system. Given the text and corresponding speech, our system synthesizes face and body animations simultaneously, which are then skinned and rendered to obtain a video stream output. We adopt a learning-based approach for synthesizing facial animation and a graph-based approach to animate the body, which generates  high-quality avatar animation efficiently and robustly. Our results demonstrate the generated avatar animations are realistic, diverse and highly text/speech-correlated.","https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2022/0863.pdf"
