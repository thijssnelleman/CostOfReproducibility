[X] Theoretical

### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors describe new algorithms for computing fair/efficient allocations of 'chores'. It is a theoretical paper and no experiments are done, so its rather implementation than re-implementation.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(0/0)

No empirical evaluation done so no datasets applicable.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors state pseudo code in algorithm 1,2 and three with several input variables, but no experiments are done so no algorithm configurations apply (if any).

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

No empirical evaluation done.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

Requires (theoretical) expertise with logic/reasoning to understand the theorems and proofs, as well as MAS/game theory to understand the task and its solutions as well as the concept of 'fairness' in this domain.
