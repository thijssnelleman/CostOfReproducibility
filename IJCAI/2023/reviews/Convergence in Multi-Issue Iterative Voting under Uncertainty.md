### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide a link to their implementation. They state they implement certain techniques/frameworks from other papers in section 2. No other details are given regarding the implementation.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[9]

(0/1)

The authors state in section five the parameters of the problem they use for their experiments (n,p and r). They state generate the data by sampling the agents' preference randomly. Due to the lack of implementation documentation this leaves a lot to be figured out by the independent investigators. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors analyse the impact of various data parameters for convergence. No algorithm configuration applicable. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state how the data was sampled in section 5. They measure the number of cycles in the data, procentual non-equilibirium, number of convergence steps and 'borda welfere change' which they explain in footnote 3. In general this experiment requires some experience with the problem.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[7]

Requires experience in the stated problem.
