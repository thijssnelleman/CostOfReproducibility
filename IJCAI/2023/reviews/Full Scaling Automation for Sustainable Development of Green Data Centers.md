### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors state on which OS the implementation for the experiments was run. In figure 1 the model architecture is presented in detail. No implementation is shared. No other details specified except in section 5 that it was succesfully deployed.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[9]

(0/1)

The authors collect the data themselves, and give a few examples of their sources including what metrics were collected. The data is not published and a full description in details is missing. No statistics nor features details on the data is presented. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[10]

Training procedures are stated in section 3, but none of these parameters are named in the experiments.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[2]

The authors state their metrics in section 4.2 which are standard. In the table captions they state they present the average over 5 runs. There are some details stated on how the training data was split from the testing set but this requires a bit of effort to determine exactly how it went. The authors also present their deployment results, which is seemingly 'straightforward' but many detailed questions can be asked how the results were measured.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requires an experience with time series data and bayesian methods.
