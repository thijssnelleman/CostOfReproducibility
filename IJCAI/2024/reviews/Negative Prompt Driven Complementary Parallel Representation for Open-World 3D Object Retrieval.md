### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors introduce a new framework and present four benchmark data sets on which they show SOTA method results. However no link is provided to the implementations.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[7]

(0/4)

The authors present four generated datasets based on public data sets. Details are provided on how these are generated/build from other public data sets which are cited, but no link is found to these new datasets.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[4]

The authors state the HP values used are presented in the implemtation details, but it is not clear if all necessary values are there as there is no summary on the HPs of the methods. It is not explained how these values were acquired. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[3]

The authors state their used metrics in 5.2, which they state are standard. The experiments seem to indicate pretrained models were used and evaluated on their complete datasets.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[9]

Requries a good understanding of the task to follow the framework presented and the data sets introduced. Especially since implementation documentation and the newly presented datasets are not given.
