### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[2]

The authors provide a URL to their implementation in the references (https://github.com/yohayt/two_sided_fairness). It also contains a full version of the paper which contains a technical appendix. The authors state some requirements regarding their code in the readme, and an unstructured output example. They also state where the settings of the method can be changed. The code has some comments but could use more explanation.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(1/1)

The data (an adapted version of a public data set) is available in the implementation documentation. In the paper they cite the source. A description on the task is given. No statistics are given on the data but could be extracted from the citation or the implementation docs.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors state the configurable parameters in the implementation documentation, and how they can be changed, with default/given values. They explore results with varying values of these parameters both in their work as well as the technical appendix.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors state eaach experiment was repeated 10 times due to stochasticity. There is no training procedure for this method, so the experiments are straightforward. The authors state the metrics computer briefly, which are self explanatory given the task. 

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[4]

Requries a good understanding of the task to understand the experiments presented, as well als algorithm selection / MAS.
