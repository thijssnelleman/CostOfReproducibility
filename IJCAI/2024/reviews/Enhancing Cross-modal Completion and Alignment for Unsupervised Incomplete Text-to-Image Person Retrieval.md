### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[10]

The authors do not provide their implementation. They state details regarding the base used for their method with citation. Figure 2 and 3 illustrate the flow of the method.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(2/2)

The authors state two data sets with citations, descriptions and statistics in their paper. They are openly available. Direct links are not provided.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[5]

The authors state the values regarding the training procedure HPs in the implementation details, but it is difficult to verify if all needed values are given. No specification on how these values were acquired.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

The authors state how the data is partitioned in 4.1 including training/testing data division, and the evaluation metric which they state is commonly used but not explained/cited. The results in table 1 and 2 indicate single model/run results.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[5]

Requires expertise in text-image person retrieval, as certain details regarding the experiment are assumed as prior knowledge. The method is complex and layered, requiring a good understanding of the respective subdomains.
