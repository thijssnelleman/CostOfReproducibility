[X] Theoretical

### Implementation
_Given the documentation given by the authors on the method, how much time investment would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[1]

The authors produce theoretical analysis and proofs, produce pseudo code on possible algorithms and state that this 'paves the way towards the implementation and practical application'. No implementation was done by the authors, thus it would not be re-implementing but implementing.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort take to either: Find the same dataset the authors used, or similar datasets and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[1]

(0/0)

No empirical evaluation done, authors pave the way towards practical application in this paper.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for their results, and compare against their budgetary constraints?_

[1]

The authors present to algorithms but do not do a practical application/analysis on them. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the experimental set-up of the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment, similar to those presented in the original work, with the same procedure?_

[1]

No empirical evaluation done.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying on the available documentation?_

[10]

In order to fully grasp this work, the presented problem needs to be thoroughly understood, and the independent investigator needs to have a lot of previous experience in including computational complexity and logic/reasoning. This is due to the sheer complexity of the concept presented.
