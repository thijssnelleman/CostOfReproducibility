### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[6]

The authors do not provide their implementation. Detailed pseudo code is given in algorithm 1 and detailed overview in figure 1 that contain a lot of information. No practical information such as packages used provided.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[5]

(1/1)

The authors use synthetic functions that are well documented in table 1. Implementation of synthetic data not provided, but is accesible to re-implement based on the provided information and citations.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[2]

The authors state the population size parameter in 5.1. Parameters of the method summarised in algorithm 1. The authors evaluate the methods under various conditions. Structured overview is a bit lacking.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

The authors state the experiment details in 5.1, that each experiment was repeated 30 times and a maximum of function evaluations of 30k. They report mean and standard deviation. Metrics are values of the synthetic functions.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
