### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[9]

The authors do not share their implementation. Detailed overviews in fig 1-3. No practical details provided.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[2]

(1/1)

The authors use bearing data from Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and provide a citation and description in 4.1.1. Statistics provided in table 1. Link is not provided. 

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[4]

The authors state the hyperparameters in text in 4.1.2. No acquisition or structured overview.

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[1]

The authors measure training accuracy and testing accuracy over 20 trials with average + standard deviation as well as training error over epochs.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
