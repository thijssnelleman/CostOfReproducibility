### Implementation
_Given the documentation shared by the authors on a new method, how much effort would it be to re-implement the method from scratch?_

[8]

The authors do not provide their implementation. Overview of the method in figure 1 and 2. Pseudo code in 4.5 with a lot of provided details.

### Data
_Given the data description in the documentation, how much effort would it take to either: Find the same data set the authors used, or a similar data set and defend the comparability, or acquire one from scratch?_

[3]

(4/4)

The authors use the Weizmann Action and Robustness Data Set (5.2, described and cited), the The Ballet Data Set (5.3, described and cited), the  UCF sports dataset (5.4, described and cited) and Facial Expression dataset (5.5, cited and described). The authors provide examples of the datasets. No statistics provided, or direct links.

### Configuration 
_Given the (hyper)parameters, including semantic parameters, of the method: How much effort would it take to acquire the algorithm configurations used for obtaining the reported results, and compare them against their computation budget?_

[3]

The authors discuss parameter settings in 5.1 at length. The values are stated in text (no structured overview). Most values are provided in grids, but motivation is sometimes lacking on how these grids were determined. For other values they provide citations. 

### Experimental Procedure
_Given the setup of experiments reported in the work, how difficult is it to set up a new experiment with the same procedure, similar to those presented in the original work?_

[4]

The authors apply cross validation, but the number of runs is not completely clear. They present the mean accuracy. The split is not clear.

### Expertise
_How much effort would it take to acquire the expertise required to reproduce the work independently relying solely on the available documentation?_
