    "We also conducted a brief analysis by enriching our collected data with data from SCOPUS, using Pybliometrics. We were able to enrich 854 reviews. From this data, we used the citation count and the majority country of origin of the author's affiliation to calculate the Kendall correlation with the average cost. We found that the citation count has no significant correlation with $0.05$, whereas the affiliation country only has a weak negative correlation of $-0.16$. We do recognise that making claims based on this meta information may lead to a misunderstanding between the found correlation of sensitive information, such as country of affiliation origin, and thus do not attach any claims or conclusions to this information."
